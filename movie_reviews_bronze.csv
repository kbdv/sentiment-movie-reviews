Kung Fu Panda 4,Chris Sawin,"_Kung Fu Panda 4_ isn’t the best _Kung Fu Panda_ film, or even the best of the series’ three sequels. However, as a fourth film in a franchise, it’s a ton of fun.

And though it’s action isn’t quite as entertaining as its predecessors and it’s unfortunate to see Awkwafina playing yet another thief (_Jumanji: The Next Level_ says hello), for the most part, _Kung Fu Panda 4_ happily skadooshes its way to animated greatness.

Damsel,thorian93,"Today I enjoyed: Damsel.

Damsel is a Netflix Original, that was released just a few days ago. Starring a strong cast with Millie Bobby Brown, Robin Wright, Angela Bassett and the voice of Shohreh Aghdashloo it follows the odyssey of Elodie. I am not going to spoil the plot for you, but I bet you can foresee most developments, dear reader.

Overall I have mixed feelings. The story is nothing new, most elements are well known for this kind of movie. Some decisions of characters (including the dragon) feel dumb, and sometimes our main character gets very lucky, so the rest of the plot can happen. The CGI ranges from poor to pretty good, poor more in the begging, with huge landscapes and castles, but later, when the dragon makes an appearance, it looks pretty decent. But I was watching on a rather small screen and Netflix is punishing me with mediocre quality for some time now. So take my visual rating with a grain of salt. Now one thing I will say about the dragon: It has an interesting spin to it. For one thing, half of the time, we do not really see it and only hear Shohreh Aghdashloo's deep, rasping voice, bringing it to life. And when we actually see the dragon, it has a slight horror touch if you will. It looks like a hybrid between your average majestic and broadly loved dragon and something more dark and slimy. A muskrat comes to mind. I liked that (sort of).

One remark towards the title: While it is obviously a play the well known 'Damsel in distress' and obviously Elodie fights instead of needing to be rescued, she screams a lot and actually seems in distress half of the film. Until she suddenly becomes the hero and single-handedly fights the dragon. It is a bit much and hard to believe.

This is in all honesty an average movie. It is neither terrible nor great. If you are in the mood for some imagery, gold and jewels, dragons, princesses, and a few swords, then go for it. There are worse ways to spend roughly 109 minutes. But there are also better ways.

Damsel,Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://talkingfilms.net/damsel-review-a-generic-yet-immersive-fantasy-flick/

""Damsel attempts to deliver a tale of empowerment and adventure within the rich fantasy genre but finds itself entangled in the ropes of predictability and missed opportunities for deeper narrative innovation.

Despite its shortcomings, the film shines through its technical prowess, from visually stunning effects to immersive world-building, and is anchored by Millie Bobby Brown’s compelling lead performance.

While it may not redefine its genre or leave an indelible mark on the history of cinema, it’s a pleasant home viewing with moments of genuine charm and resilience.""

No Way Up,OrlyForly,"Terrible Script, dialogue, directing, hammy editing. Music is meh. Poor acting (but they clearly got no support). This crap show's the contempt producers like this have for the audience that gives them money. The writer, director, producers and editor must have been so full of ego that I bet continues today, despite the poor reviews. During the boring minutes (90) I drifted off imagining them all working on these scenes thinking they were amazing, and trying to understand the level of narcissism required. Just delusional film makers that like the smell of each others farts. During the credits I imagined the director is still down there and that's what got it 0.5 rather than 0.",1.0
No Way Up,Chandler Danier,This movie is less realistic than Slotherhouse. No one on the crew had their Open Water certification.

Argylle,Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://talkingfilms.net/argylle-review-a-delightful-surprise-of-campy-entertainment/

""Argylle emerges as a (very) pleasant surprise this new year, blending absurdity with sophistication to create a truly memorable cinematic experience.

Matthew Vaughn's vision, combined with Jason Fuchs' sharp, clever screenplay, provides an entertainment rollercoaster ride that obliterates initial expectations. From unexpected twists and turns to the incredibly charismatic cast, not to mention a third act filled with hilariously unforgettable action set pieces, the complex-made-simple spy story captivates the audience with its campy charm and relentless energy.

It's my first big recommendation of 2024, one you can't afford to miss in theaters!""

Rating: A-",8.0
Argylle,CinemaSerf,"""Elly Conway"" (Bryce Dallas Howard) lives in her remote lakeside home writing spy novels that are going down a storm. Her conclusion to the fifth in the series about the eponymous, ""007""-style agent perplexes her mother, though. What happens next? Well wait til book six would seem to be the obvious answer, but mom (Catherine O'Hara) insists so ""Elly"" decides to take train to visit her parents - and that's mistake number one. Onboard she encounters a rather scruffy looking chap ""Wilde"" (Sam Rockwell) who is reading one of her books. She tries to hide her identity, but when he gets to the fly-leaf then her secret is out. That's soon the least of her worries as she and travelling cat ""Alfie"" are soon caught up in something straight out of one of her books! She can't fathom why she'd conceivably be the target for any nasty people, but her new found friend soon convinces her that there is someone she has to meet - and pretty quickly she's embroiled in an whole new world of mystery, intrigue and danger! It's a bit of a slow start this film, with a slightly annoying flicking between her real life and those of her characterisations (that's where the ""Action Man"" style of the sparingly used Henry Cavill appears) but once we establish who is who and what's going on, we are straight into ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."" territory with loads of rapid-fire escapades that though hardly original, do have some fun twists and turns as we progress to a denouement that is derivative, but still quite enjoyable to watch. The initial concept is quite original and though the execution largely an amalgam of other Matthew Vaughn features, it still works quite well even if it is far too long, with Rockwell clearly having some fun here and the cat remaining largely contained in it's capsule throughout!",7.0
Argylle,Brent Marchant,"It’s disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn’s latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that’s trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, “So what’s it going to be?” There’s also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we’ve already seen before in movies like “Romancing the Stone” (1984), “The Long Kiss Goodnight” (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it’s true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there’s a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there’s the picture’s excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. “Argylle” also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn’t quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what’s conveyed in the picture’s video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O’Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn’t nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. “Argylle” apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we’ll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it.",5.0

Argylle,r96sk,"Such a peculiar film. Everything about it feels off.

I was initially a little unsure as to what I thought about <em>'Argylle'</em>, but in the end: it's a no from me. I couldn't actually tell you one thing that I properly liked about this, like at a push Sam Rockwell and Bryan Cranston are decent but even they get a bit hit-and-miss. There's just a constant tinge of lousiness that follows around throughout.

Bryce Dallas Howard feels miscast, even if she is fairly likeable. Henry Cavill is wooden (intentionally? doubtful), as is Dua Lipa but the musician has enough charm to make it work slightly. Speaking of music, all that is used here is alright but again feels off - mostly seems like the correct type of song, just the wrong exact choice of song... ""Electric Energy"" might grow on me, though.

What also doesn't help is the unavoidable feeling that it is a bad redo of <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/films/in/kingsman-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/"" rel=""nofollow"">Kingsman</a>'</em>, which is expected given who directed this and all that they are planning with the two flicks behind the scenes. I'm all for a shared universe, though this is perhaps too on the nose. There are also <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lost-city-2022/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Lost City</a>'</em> (itself echoing <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/nims-island/"" rel=""nofollow"">Nim's Island</a>'</em>) vibes sprinkled in too. Another negative is the special effects, especially at the start... less said, the better.

Overall, I think it all boils down to being a poor film - unfortunately, as I kinda wanted to like it but simply couldn't. Actually, it's just come to me, I just remembered a scene I actually did truly enjoy: the one with Leona Lewis' ""Run"" track. That was actually entertaining.",5.0

Dune: Part Two,Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://talkingfilms.net/dune-part-two-review-the-new-generational-epitome-of-sci-fi-epics/

""Dune: Part Two surpasses even the highest expectations, establishing itself as an unquestionable technical masterpiece of blockbuster filmmaking.

With a narrative that deepens the complex web of political relationships, power, faith, love, and destiny, it not only provides a breathtaking audiovisual spectacle, thanks to the genius of Denis Villeneuve, Greig Fraser, and Hans Zimmer, but it also offers a profound meditation on universal human themes through thematically rich world-building and thoroughly developed characters. The superb performances of the entire cast, led by a career-best Timothée Chalamet and a mesmerizing Zendaya, further elevate this incredibly immersive cinematic experience.

It warrants comparisons with the greatest sequels in history, easily becoming the new generational epitome of sci-fi epics.""

Rating: A+",10.0
Dune: Part Two,r96sk,"As anticipated, a thrilling watch!

I enjoyed <em>'Dune'</em>, though remember thinking it was obviously a complete set-up to a sequel and that this would only improve upon its predecessor - and that's very much the case. <em>'Dune: Part Two'</em> is excellent! My interest did wane slightly at roughly the middle part, as was similarly the case with the first film in truth, but that was a feeling that only lasted for a relativiely short time.

All in all, it's fantastic. The acting is top notch, the visuals are breathtaking <em>(those sandworms tho)</em> and the score is outstandingly hefty - you can always rely on the great Hans Zimmer! Timothée Chalamet stars yet again, as do the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Dave Bautista & Co. The person I actually enjoyed most on screen was Javier Bardem, who is truly brilliant throughout. 

Bring on <em>'Dune Messiah'</em>! On that note, happy to read that director Denis Villeneuve has noted that he won't be rushing that one out - and rightly so!",9.0
Dune: Part Two,CinemaSerf,"This is certainly a great looking film to see on a big screen with some really effective, almost industrially sounding, audio - but what happened to the story? It's wafer thin and really stretched out for 2¾ hours. We pick up with ""Paul"" (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) trying to convince the ""Fremen"" that they are worth the hassle. Fortunately, leader ""Stilgar"" (Javier Bardem) is convinced of the messianic state of the young refugee, whilst their own reverend mother is on her last legs which might give ""Jessica"" a chance to prove her own worth, and provide an opportunity to peddle some embellished mythology about her son's ascendant propheteering. All of this manoeuvring and politicking is having quite an impact on ""Chani"" (the under-used Zendaya) and on the relationship between her and the increasingly worshipped new Duke. Meantime, now fully reinvigorated and emerged from his bath of recuperative Guinness, the evil ""Baron Harkonnen"" (an almost Zeppelin-like Stellan Skarsgård) has recruited his lethal nephew ""Feyd-Rautha"" (Austin Butler) to get to grips with the rebellion on ""Arrakis"" that is bringing him into the gaze of an ill-satisfied emperor (Christopher Walken). Battle lines are drawn! Now whilst I did enjoy this, the rest of the film is a gloriously photographed but slowly paced hybrid of ""Khartoum"" (1966) and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) with a bit of the ""Phantom Menace"" (1999) thrown in for good measure. The acting is adequate but the characterisations are all too routinely sacrificed at the altar of the stunning visuals and from about an hour to go, I was convinced this this was but part two of three (or maybe even more). Walken and Charlotte Rampling feature all too sparingly to make much difference, indeed even Zendaya's warrior-like tendencies seem to have been neutered rather and I though that Chalamet just tried far too hard to imbue his character with a strength that he was far more successful with first time round. That said, it does work well enough as a classy and well produced sci-fi adventure with plenty of action and mysticism but I needed more meat on it's bones. I still get distinctly squeamish when I watch what they do with the water, let alone where they get it from!!",7.0
Dune: Part Two,Chandler Danier,Great but a little long. Sexier than LotR and no hair. Yell acting. Jabba bathes in black goo and kills women horribly. Walken is hilarious. Zendaya still an addict. Bridges is a bit self-serious. Amazing visuals. Really enjoyed...was glad and a bit bored by the end. Shorter Dunes please.,9.0
Code 8 Part II,MovieGuys,"The first Code 8 movie, was never going to be an award winner but at least it had an element of danger, pacing and excitement. 

Regrettably, its sequel, seems to be more a vehicle for woke tropes than  an actual sci fi film. It appears to be mostly about people from diverse backgrounds being either abused by ""the system"" or co-opted into it, as state sponsored abusers. 

The results feels like what it is. A moral statement viewed from a particular point of view, rather than an exciting, sci fi film, which is what, in this reviewers opinion, it should have been. 

Its slow paced, not terribly exciting and really goes nowhere interesting but then, how could it? 

In summary, I, for one, am sick and tired of having simple escapist entertainment hi-jacked to peddle a specific world view. That is what activism and social commentary are for. Of course, the irony too, is the harder this kind of thing is foisted on people, in my experience, the more they tend to reject it.",4.0

""Not only is Poor Things the best movie of the festival, but it's also the best of the year so far, as well as a new personal favorite of Yorgos Lanthimos' career.

A brilliantly thought-provoking, insanely hilarious story packed with substance, focused on a fascinating self-discovery journey filled with thematically rich layers. Astonishing performances from the entire cast, but Emma Stone is truly impressive as an exceptionally expressive force who should win many awards.

A technical masterclass across all filmmaking areas simply puts the icing on top of a near-perfect cake.""

Rating: A",9.0
Poor Things,Brent Marchant,"When the circumstances of our lives don’t suit us, it’s time to reinvent ourselves – something that happens both literally and metaphorically in this latest offering from director Yorgos Lanthimos. But the way that result comes about here represents a truly inspired fusion of genres, including comedy, romance, social commentary and sci-fi, making for one of the most inventive, unusual and hilarious releases of recent years. This offbeat feminist fable tells the story of how a pregnant, young, anonymous suicide victim (Emma Stone) is reanimated with the aid of a brain transplant from her unborn fetus, an achievement accomplished by a colorful, controversial but well-meaning surgeon/scientist a la Dr. Frankenstein (Willem Dafoe). He nurtures his subject back to life, health and sentience, a sometimes-challenging process that finally surfaces when she discovers sexuality, the trigger for exploring a new, independent life for herself, both physically and emotionally. Through a series of adventures over the course of a trip through Europe with a free-wheeling, lusty but lecherous, self-serving lawyer (Mark Ruffalo), she finds herself as a self-actualized woman in an age where that’s more of a rarity than a standard, particularly in a world where men treat women more like property than people. While the film’s pacing could use some shoring up in the middle, this offering nevertheless entertains with uproarious laughs throughout, even when the narrative turns more thoughtful and substantive. The superb performances by Stone, Dafoe and Ruffalo are top shelf, contributing to the picture’s whopping 13 Critics Choice Award and 7 Golden Globe Award nominations. The film is also visually stunning in its cinematography and editing, as well as in its spectacular and whimsical production design, filled with images reminiscent of the movies of Wes Anderson and Terry Gilliam while sustaining a look all its own. Admittedly, this release features a good deal of explicit sexuality, both visually and in the dialogue, so sensitive viewers should take note. However, as one of the most anticipated pictures of this year’s awards season, “Poor Things” never disappoints, serving up a solid offering that consistently tickles the funny bone while giving audiences much to think about – and there’s nothing poor in any of that.",8.0
Poor Things,CinemaSerf,"It's almost as if Yorgos Lanthimos had sat down for a transcendental conversation with James Whale! Student ""Max"" (Ramy Youssef) is a student recruited by his professor ""Godwin"" (Willem Dafoe - aka ""God"") to come and help him work on his latest project. She's called ""Bella"" (Emma Stone) and it soon transpires that she is the product of some very creative surgery on the part of ""God"" - a man who has, himself, had one or two experiences under the knife at the hands of his scientist father! You see, a pregnant woman took her own life by jumping from a bridge, but was luckily fished out of the water before her baby died. The surgeon managed to deliver the baby then replace the dead brain of the adult with the one from the nascent infant! Needless to say, ""Bella"" is on an actively steep learning curve and is quite capable of throwing the odd tantrum to get what she wants - and that is, initially, to go out and explore. Gradually more empowered, and a little more mature, she discovers the delights of the orgasm - and after that there's no stopping her. ""God"" tries to control her by suggesting a marriage to ""Max"" but he insists on such a fastidious contract that ""Duncan"" (Mark Ruffalo) concludes she must be worth investigating. He meets her and offers her her dreams, she convinces ""God"" to let her go with him and soon she is embarked on a trip around Europe enjoying the frequent delights of ""furious jumping""! The always learning woman soon tires of her beau, and realises that she can have loads of fun and earn at the same time - before ""God"" falls ill and she must return home to not just that life, but surprisingly to the one she thought she had left behind on the bridge. This film is genuinely laugh-out-loud at times, and the performance from Emma Stone has to be her best. She plays the almost porcelain-like and childish ""Bella"" when we meet her expertly, and that skill prevails as her character evolves into a savvy, street-smart and capable woman who quickly learns to fight fire with fire. Ruffalo is also on super form as her travelling companion and Kathryn Hunter also turns in a solid performance as her Parisian paymaster ""Swiney"". The narrative takes us on a fantastic tour of European cities, but also on a wonderfully evocative tour of humanity - warts and all. ""Bella"" has a practical and analytical mind that at times seems ludicrously detached, then somehow she ends up having got it right all along. It might look a bit long at just shy of 2½ hours but it really flies by and I couldn't help but feel sorry for the poor billy goat at the end of this creatively interpreted and very well adapted story of what were originally supposed to be Glaswegian hotspots!",7.0
Poor Things,r96sk,"Superb! It's quite the ride!

I don't have the film school-esque analysis to adequately describe all this, so I'll very much leave that to others. What I can note, though, is that I had a great time watching <em>'Poor Things'</em>. It's incredible. I have many a positive, though the main one is obvious: Emma Stone. All I can say is: Bravo! A truly outstanding performance!

Another major, major plus is the music. Wow! Sensational. It's so commanding throughout, blowing me away in what felt like every few minutes... and yet, it never distracts or takes you out from any scene unfolding onscreen. One of the greatest scores I've heard in a very long time. That aside, the visuals are amazing - from the colours to the sets, major props to all those behind the scenes. It all looks exquisite.

Stone isn't alone in impressing, as Willem Dafoe is brilliant too - loved his showing in this, the accent is particularly well fitting. Mark Ruffalo is praiseworthy too, as is everyone else to be honest - e.g. Ramy Youssef and Kathryn Hunter. They all partake in a quite bizarre plot, but one that is absolutely absorbing from beginning to conclusion.

Pre-watch I was somewhat expecting that this was going to be one of those (having not researched anything, as per) overly artsy flicks that I wouldn't connect with, delightfully I was totally wrong. I also felt, when Christopher Abbott's character appears, that the film should've ended earlier, though again I was incorrect because the film simply manages to continue at such a hugh quality.

Poor Things,BornKnight,"Fantasy drama- comedy adult film directed by Yorgos Lanthimos (The Killing of the Sacred Deer, The Lobster, The Favourite) and written by Tony McNamara (The Great, The Favorite, Cruella), being based on the 1992's novel by Alasdair Gray, that Lanthimos liked and even went to Scotland in 2009 to buy the direct of the movie.

Having a victorian semi-steampunk and exquisite atmosphere it tells the story of a newly created woman Bella Baxter, with her body reanimated by the eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, that discovering that after her suicide jumping a bridge she was pregnant, and uses the unborn fetus brain on her head.

After this she went on a journey from a Frankenstein character and develops her tastes and skills gradually till the end of the filme. I must say that some sexual scenes with Emma Stone and her character sexual appetite are most daring and shows how she grow as and actress in all aspect.

The main core of roles are Emma Stone as Bella Baxter, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn, Willem Dafoe as Dr. Godwin Baxter and as a lesser role Ramy Youssef as Max McCandles.

According to the cinematographer, Ryan Williams (American Honey, The Favorite) in conjunction with the director Lanthimos used an array of cameras, lens and films included Nikon, Angenieux Optimo and Zeiss Master Zooms, an ultra-wide PL-mount Optex 4mm fisheye, designed for 16mm/S16mm cinematography, that opens up to T2, plus antique 58mm and 85mm Petzvals. Ryan selected EASTMAN DOUBLE-X Black & White Negative Film 5222 for the movie's opening B&W sequences, KODAK EKTACHROME Color Reversal Film 100D 5294 for Bella's elopement and adventures with Wedderburn, and KODAK VISION3 500T Color Negative Film 5219 for the film's denouement.

The production design by Shona Heath	and James Price and the equip of art direction and prosthetics made and incredible job plus with the unique costume design by Holly Waddington (Lady MacBeth, Clash of Titans) also are striking, from the more bizarre childish dresses used on the start of the film to the more adut  on the end. All this with a modest budget of $35 million.

The movie have 11 Academy nominations for Best Achievement in Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures (Original Score), Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Achievement in Directing, Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Achievement in Cinematography, Best Achievement in Film Editing, Best Achievement in Production Design, Best Achievement in Costume Design and  already have 11 BAFTA awards plus Venice Film Festival 2 awards, Golden Lion Best Film and Yorgos Lanthimos 2023 Winner UNIMED Award.

The characters are your usual array of entitled, obnoxious, US military types, who go on a flawed escapade in someone else's country to retrieve a CIA asset. Things turn sour and well the rest is your by the book, bravado, darning do, bravery, codswallop.

Fight scenes are frenetic, well paced and impressive. Lots of pyrotechnics and slow motion bullet and shell casing shots.Certainly from an exposition point of view, this film is not dull. 

Acting is unremarkable but its the story that really leaves a lot to be desired. Putting aside its predictable bias, this tale is cliched, pedestrian and utterly predictable. Its essentially, every stale, second rate, US military action flick, you have ever seen with Australians and New Zealanders, in the lead.

Anyone But You,CinemaSerf,"Despite myself, I actually quite enjoyed this.

Against their better judgment our two decide to pretend to be a couple to provoke envy from one and protect the other from the intent of the meddling parents. What now ensues does really depend on a plausible degree of chemistry between Sweeney and Powell and I thought they did quite well. A little bit more meddling from Bryan Brown, some Di Caprio-esque action at the front of a yacht and some kindly support from the Sydney harbour rescue helicopter helps keep this amiably jogging along for an admittedly twenty minutes too long 1¾ hours. It's quite pithily written and manages to avoid the worst in both American and Australian stereotypes. It also isn't shy of sex, comic nudity and a bit of practical adult humour that makes a change from the usual puerile smut we are so frequently offered nowadays. It's entirely forgettable, but is an enjoyable enough dollop of sun, sea, sex and silliness.",7.0
Anyone But You,r96sk,"Imperfect, though <em>'Anyone But You'</em> does deliver amusing moments and works nicely as a romcom.

It usually isn't the best sign when the end credits are a film's best bit, which is the case here (s/o Natasha Bedingfield!), though thankfully that statement is only an additional positive for this Will Gluck directed movie. It does do clichés, but does at least add some freshness to the genre.

Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell portray great chemistry, I enjoyed both performances. Sweeney's stylist killed it I gotta say, heck even Powell's too. Some of their, and others', dialogue is too manufactured  at times, but that be just a minor complaint to be honest. The rest of those onscreen are satisfactory. I must say the director's father, Peter Gluck, gave me one of the film's stronger chuckles in his tiny role on the plane sat next to Sweeney - perfect line delivery!

I had fun with this. As already noted, it isn't anything all that standout but it delivered what I evidently wanted. Solid. The William Shakespeare stuff was a bit forced, mind you.",7.0
Oppenheimer,Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.firstshowing.net/2023/review-nolans-oppenheimer-is-a-harrowing-tale-of-one-mans-life/

""Oppenheimer is a true masterclass in how to build extreme tension and suspense through fast, detailed dialogue, an insanely powerful sound production, and an equally explosive score from Ludwig Göransson. Words cannot fully describe Hoyte van Hoytema's gorgeous cinematography.

It's a harrowing, disturbing, genuinely frightening story about how one man's compulsion and political power changed the world. Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt shouldn't miss any awards ceremonies… they're absolutely superb, as are the rest of the exceptional actors involved in the movie.

Pacing, structure, and runtime, in addition to its quasi-documentary style and its narrative complexity, make this a difficult, heavy watch that will, for sure, leave some viewers disappointed, bored, or simply tired. Ultimately, Christopher Nolan justifies the use of the expression ""not for everyone"".

Rating: A-",8.0
Oppenheimer,fireheart92,"**OPPENHEIMER IS ""NOT FOR EVERYONE"" AS STATED BY CHRISTROPHER NOLAN BEFORE THE RELEASE OF THE FILM HIMSELF. ** But those who have ample knowledge of physics and chemistry, this film is a masterpiece. The film takes the viewer into the mind of the ""Father of the atomic bomb"" how he thinks, how he feels with much accuracy. Nolan beautifully explains his life both on a private and professional front. The music, the sounds with each scene are top notch. The visuals of QUANTUM PHYSICS, FISSION, NUCLEAR EXPLOSION are mind-boggling. 

If possible, watch it in IMAX. 

THE MOVIE IS FULL OF DIALOGUES, CONVERSATIONS MOVING BACK AND FORTH IN TIMELINE. It's a historical biography with fantabulous acting by C.M., E.B., R.D.J. and more. The scenes with ALBERT EINSTEIN are just wow. A plethora of scientists(BOHR, FERMI, TELLER, HEISENBERG) of the age can be seen throughout.  There are no action scenes if you are in search of that. 

IT IS A CINEMATOGRAPHIC BRILLIANCE. IF U CAN'T WATCH SIENTIFIC HISTORY JUST DON'T GO.",10.0
Oppenheimer,Brent Marchant,"Telling the story of a larger-than-life individual truly calls for a larger-than-life film, and that’s precisely what writer-director Christopher Nolan has come up with in his latest feature outing, handily the best work of his career. Nolan’s three-hour opus about the life of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), director of the Manhattan Project (and more commonly known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb), provides viewers with a comprehensive biography of this brilliant and thoughtful yet often-inscrutable and naïve physicist who took on a patently dangerous venture that left him morally conflicted about the nature of his creation. The story, which spans several decades of the scientist’s life, chronicles his development of “the gadget” and the fallout he suffered as a consequence of his left-wing political leanings and his efforts to keep the released nuclear genie from getting out of control. The film is admittedly a little overlong and probably could have used some editing in the opening and final hour, but, in the interest of telling the whole story of Oppenheimer’s odyssey, its length is understandable (and, consequently, justifiable). The picture’s production values are all top shelf, especially its brilliant cinematography, stirring original score and superb sound quality, an element that truly leaves audiences with a bona fide visceral experience. Moreover, the narrative is skillfully and eloquently brought to life by this offering’s outstanding ensemble cast, including Murphy, Matt Damon, Tom Conti, Benny Safdie, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, and, especially, Robert Downey Jr., who delivers a stellar, award-worthy supporting performance showing acting chops that I never knew he possessed. “Oppenheimer” is easily the best film of the summer movie season, if not all of 2023 thus far. It packs a potent punch and delivers a message that we can all never hear too often, poignantly reminding us all of the importance of not falling prey to the same Promethean burden that Oppenheimer was forced to shoulder.",9.0
Oppenheimer,CinemaSerf,"Cillian Murphy offers an assured and considered performance here as the man who is credited with developing the bomb that hastened the end of WWII in the far east. He is the increasingly acclaimed, eponymous, physicist who is made aware by Admiral Lewis Strauss (another strong performance from Robert Downey Jr.) that it just possible that the Russians have the A-bomb. Now Oppenheimer already suspects that the Nazis are also well on their way to weaponising the atom - his earlier education and career had introduced him to some of the prominent minds in the UK and in Germany who were quite capable of taking the theory forward; so he begins to pressurise the American government to begin it's own programme - and the ""Manhattan Project"" is born. Motivated/goaded/galvanised by the ambitious ""Col. Groves"" (Matt Damon) he assembles a formidable collection of scientific minds at a purpose built, desert, location which he christens Los Alamos, and over the next three years - and with $2bn to spend - they work on the science whilst plutonium and uranium are being simultaneously processed at an irkingly glacial pace! Given that much of this is reasonably well documented history, the actual plot here has little by way of jeopardy. Instead, Christopher Nolan attempts via his writing and direction to put some meat on the bones of the characters here. It's clear that Oppenheimer is a bit of a Lothario, but it's also clear that he can engender the loyalty of a variety of people with diverging views - not just surrounding the science of their project, but around the morals and ethics of creating something that - well, you can't get the toothpaste back into the tube. The latter portion of this drama focusses on the subsequent, communist-obsessed, witch-hunting that went on attempting to persecute and smear this remarkable and flawed individual, and it makes some interesting postulations about just who was pulling whose strings. It also has quite a penetrating resonation about it - not just, specifically, about Oppeneheimer - but about all of those post-event ""enquiries"" that rarely deliver an honest appraisal of what was done in the name of expediency at the time, but ends up more of a character assassination exercise by those who didn't do anything against those who did and had to. Though at times the pace of this thing helps to keep it enthralling, it is too long - at times it really does plod along. Perhaps an other, objective, eye on the writing/direction may have tightened it up without having to sacrifice any of the potency of the story. Maybe someone needs to tell Mr. Nolan that a three hour film isn't always required! That said, it's a gorgeous film to look at. The aesthetics are first rate and the entire sentiment of the film reeks of authenticity. I do think this thrives better on a big screen so try to see it as it was intended. It's though provoking, complex, characterful - and well worth a watch.",7.0

Oppenheimer,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"The intersection of innovation, science, political bureaucracy, and ethics meet in writer-director Christopher Nolan‘s “Oppenheimer,” a dark, challenging biopic about the father of the atomic bomb, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer. This profound epic clocks in at three hours yet never feels too long, even if it’s painfully clear that Nolan is indulging himself in a passion project.

During World War II, Lt. General Leslie Groves Jr. (Matt Damon) appoints physicist Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Assembling a team of the brightest scientists the country has to offer, the experts spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. When their final product is used against Japan on July 16, 1945, the world witnesses its first nuclear explosion in an event that not only ends the war, but forever changes the course of history.

There has been much hype about the fact that Nolan chose to film in IMAX, but the large format feels wasted here. The visuals are far from stunning, and the film is mostly a dramatic, dialogue-heavy history lesson that’s a far cry from what I’d call “entertaining.” It’s a great movie that’s engaging, sophisticated, and intelligent, but those expecting traditional thrills are going to be greatly disappointed. Save your money, because seeing this in IMAX isn’t really worth it.

Nolan’s film is poignant in a way that’s chillingly relevant. His story not only explores one of the most important figures in U.S. history, but also makes you think about the current lack of empathy that’s plaguing society. There’s a very real moral question about humanity’s ability to make something that will help save the lives of many but also result in the death of innocents, and Nolan makes a strong political statement in a surprisingly restrained manner. His commentary on the far-reaching effects of such a powerful weapon born from the intersection of innovation, science, and government, while being an invention that has changed but also endangered the world, will give you chills. Nolan’s script is terrific, and is one of my favorite screenplays of the year.

Nolan tells much more of the obscure back story of Oppenheimer’s professional and personal life that few know, and it makes for a lengthy (but interesting) narrative. The film includes his ties to the Communist Party, Hoover’s FBI investigation, his tangles with Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), and an eventual closed-door hearing that was designed to strip him of his security clearance years after the war ended.

“Oppenheimer” is a complex film that requires your full attention, with myriad characters and time jumps that will keep you on your toes. A basic knowledge of history is beneficial, but those who have only heard the name Robert Oppenheimer and are aware of the very basics (like the fact that he was involved in the creation of the atomic bomb) won’t be completely lost.

In addition to complicated discussions of quantum physics, there are weighty themes about the dangers of government bureaucracy and the moral and ethical implications of creating a weapon of mass destruction. Nolan isn’t the type of storyteller who is keen on hand holding, and it’s refreshing to see a riveting movie that’s made for thinking audiences.",8.0
Oppenheimer,Thulan Perera,"The cinematic masterpiece that is Oppenheimer leaves an indelible impression on anyone who watches it. Christopher Nolan has truly outdone himself with this film, delivering a poignant message about the horrors of nuclear war. The superb direction and exceptional performances by Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. and others draw you into the story, making you feel as though you are right there in the midst of it all. Even though there aren't any action scenes, the movie still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat for its entire 3-hour runtime. Oppenheimer is a biopic that everyone knows the ending to, but thanks to the expert direction and awe-inspiring performances, it is an experience that will leave a lasting impression on you.",9.0
Oppenheimer,Sarthak Bharad,"> **Oppenheimer:** I feel like I have blood on my hands, sir.
> 
> **Truman:** [takes a handkerchief from his pocket and gives it to him] You think anyone in Hiroshima or Nagasaki gives a shit about who built the bomb?

an incredibly well-written and extremely well-acted piece of dramatic cinema about the very eventful and complicated life of J. Robert Oppenheimer and it is beautiful. I'm actually surprised this is a huge summer blockbuster.

anytime Christopher Nolan releases a film, it's obviously an event all around the world because he's made tons of great films and he's one of the very few film-makers working today who really cares about cinema and values that cinematic experience. he's also one of the very few people who's actually given a budget to support his love for cinema. he shoots on film, does everything practically, he wants as little CGI as possible and he has apparently claimed that there isn't a single CGI shot in this film. if that's actually the case, like if he hasn't even included cleanup shots in the film, then my spirit just left my body. it's astounding.

went into this film with very limited knowledge about the life of Oppenheimer. like most people, I only knew him as The Father of the Atomic Bomb and the famous lines he quoted from the Bhagavad Gita which are Now I Am Become Death, The Destroyer of Worlds where he's talking about the atomic bomb realising the gravity of his creation and having to live with the sin of his achievement. I had no other knowledge about him as a person, his life outside of the invention, and the events that followed before or after it. so, if you're going into this film expecting an explosion porn, you're most likely to get disappointed having to sit through 3 hours' worth of heavy dramatic dialogue involving moments of genuinely terrifying character development. the film is about the person whose most pivotal moment in life was the success of The Manhattan Project. getting to experience being inside that person's mind as he's trying to visualize all these things combined with an incredible score by Ludwig Göransson and watching all of these rated-R, 3-hour, dialogue-heavy, beautifully shot on film by the master himself Hoyte van Hoytema with black and white sequences in a fucking theatre made me feel like I wasn't in 2023.

the performances are excellent. there really is no other word for it. from the top all the way down to the bottom of the incredibly huge cast list, there isn't a single weak link. Robert Downey Jr. is simply terrific. I haven't seen him like this since Kiss Kiss Bang Bang which came all the way back in 2005. I love him as Iron Man but that's more about the character rather than him as an actor. I wouldn't be shocked if he's nominated for a best supporting actor performance. Emily Blunt is also just really really great. there is a sequence early on in the film where Oppenheimer is being questioned and she's just sitting back there in the scene, out of focus. we're not even shown a close-up of her during this entire sequence until it becomes relevant later on in the film and we go back to that sequence when we finally realise the significance of her being there. Nolan has done quite a lot of that in this film actually. major A-list actors are in the film for like 2 scenes and then they never appear again. that's not just a testament to the actors who'd give anything to be in a Nolan-directed film but a testament to Nolan himself, as a film-maker. if we go back to the same sequence I mentioned earlier with Blunt, that's not just anyone sitting there, it's Emily Blunt. a phenomenal actress. but that's what gives the film a sense of groundedness. that the people on-screen are actual people, they behave like people. and for a certain amount of time, allows those celebrities to feel like normal people. Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Rami Malek, Jason Clarke, Dane DeHaan, I can go on and on but literally everyone is fucking phenomenal. the real star of the show though, is Cillian Murphy. in his first lead role for a Nolan film after having worked with him for almost 20 years, Murphy shines brighter than the atomic bomb itself and walks with suave leaving not just two, but a multitude of shockwaves. his work is beyond phenomenal here. he not only looks like Oppenheimer but every scene he's in, he's just instantly captivating. it's not just his incredible eyes (which go so deep that I just wanna sink myself in them) but, he's just always in character. never did I once see the guy from Red Eye or from Peaky Blinders. it was always Oppie.

I'm actually putting this review as I listen to the absolutely bonkers score that has been provided for the film. Göransson's work is truly, awesome-tacularly, riveting. my heart was beating so fast in some sequences that have this heavy, beating sounds that I could almost have a seizure. the work here is truly remarkable.

another aspect of this film that shines brighter than ever is its editing. this is a 3-hour film that feels like 2 and a half. a half-an-hour of time just evaporated for me. every scene ends perfectly. there is no room for baggage. several big moments of history fly away in an instant. this gives the film a really focused feel. it gives the audience a cue that this is not the story of the world but it is the story of Oppenheimer. Nolan really knows how to edit his films such that they have just the right runtime and I really appreciate when a film-maker does that. it very much also gives this film that documentary-esque aspect and gets you convinced that these events actually did happen and this is not just some made-up story about a man's life.

this film is truly a marvelous achievement not just for Christopher Nolan himself as a filmmaker but for cinema as a whole. peak dramatic cinema. watch this on the biggest screen possible and the loudest speakers you can find.",10.0

Oppenheimer,Peter McGinn,"Well, with ten other reviews on this site, I am not going to give a blow-by-blow assessment of what I like or don’t like. I am sure other reviews have touched upon hinge I might point out.

I will only say that I thought it a really good movie: smartly written and nicely acted. I had some trouble following details in places — not because of the complex time structure (though I admit prefer the straight ahead story style of, say, The Godfather) but rather because I couldn’t get volume up loud enough to hear when the characters spoke softly and/or quickly, and without captions I had to wait for the context of conversations to help fill in what I was missing. It was a shame to have such a little thing in the way of a good movie being great.",7.0
Oppenheimer,TheRealMina,"The movie is incredibly overrated and filled with unnecessary dramatized scenes, making it excessively long. It presents Oppenheimer as a cliche, portraying him as the world's smartest man who can learn a language in six weeks, accompanied by aggressively written advanced equations on a blackboard with a loud soundtrack.

In my opinion, this film stands as Nolan's second worst movie, following Tenet. It embodies all his negative qualities, and its duration should not have exceeded 1 hour and 40 minutes, stretching unnecessarily to 3 hours.",2.0
Oppenheimer,misubisu,"The most inefficient telling of a story that I have ever experienced. Hugely unnecessary character development and unnecessary dramatisation.

I only made it to halfway before dyeing of boredom... jumped forward a chunk... saw the president say that the Russians would never succeed in obtaining the atomic bomb (unsure as to what he based this on). The movie was a strong testament to how much the US feared penetration by communism... and the fact that the US fear themselves losing their grip on being 'the leaders of the free world' [a title that they have never deserved or earned]... and the fact that no one has learned anything from history and being in perpetual war.

Truly a missed opportunity to tell this story in a way that would have any memorable meaning.

No wonder the planet is doomed to self annihilation at the hands of the 1% (The love of money is the root of all evil).",1.0
Oppenheimer,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I was actually looking forward to watch this movie. Unfortunately I have to say I was rather disappointed when the movie came to an end.

One of the most impressive projects ever undertaken filled with scientifical challenges and performed under immense pressure.

That is what the movie should have been all about. Unfortunately it is not. Instead all the science, challenges and achievements are just glossed over and we are feed three long, boring, hours about political machinations and his sex life.

That is not what I was expecting and it is definitely not what I wanted to watch.

Trust Hollywood to turn science into a bloody soap-like drama.

Christopher Nolan is definitely not a person that should be tasked with making a science or history movie. His Dunkirk was underwhelming to say the least and Interstellar was both a poor movie and a joke when it came to science.

I guess I should have lowered my expectations when I saw they gave the movie to him.",5.0
Oppenheimer,badelf,"Honestly too long. This is really two, long films. The first half deals mostly with the science and the scientists. The second half/film deals with the political and moral repercussions of the science.

Outside the story, Nolan has given us a top notch cast performing at their peak, beautiful cinematography, and a delicious score.",8.0
Oppenheimer,Amiiae011,"**Oppenheimer may not be for many people, but it was wonderful for me.** This movie does require some knowledge and interest in science, but it doesn't mean that you have to be an expert. I surely recommend doing some research before and after watching the film to better understand it. I also recommend researching about the simple facts of the Manhattan Project, who the people involved in the Manhattan Project are, and who Oppenheimer is before and after watching the movie.

**WATCH IT ON THE BIGGEST IMAX SCREEN YOU CAN FIND, especially if you are interested in science, the true story of the Manhattan Project, and course, other Chris Nolan films. This movie was filmed specially for IMAX screening, Nolan and his crew used IMAX 70mm film and cameras, and they also invented the B&W 65mm film specially for this movie.**

I have watched every single Chris Nolan’s films ever since I was a kid. His movies have been a big part of my life and his movies are the things that helped me go through tough times and give me a new dream. Oppenheimer was just staggering. It was amazing, I do not have the words to describe my feelings watching that movie, especially seeing how much improvements Cillian, Nolan and other actors have gotten through over the years, and I was so glad that Cillian is finally getting the attention he deserves too. The cinematography, the storyline, the dialogues, the characters, the music, the camera angles, position, lighting, editing, the script, and everything else were just amazing. I have read every single line of the transcript and I have already rewatched the movie 5 times to better understand it. I also am reading the American Prometheus which is amazing. After my first time watching Oppenheimer, the thoughts and questions I had after watching it stayed with me for weeks, which led me to watch it again and again. I was amazed, it was breathtaking. The cinematography was beautiful and it couldn’t have been better. The fact that Nolan didn’t use CGI for the Trinity test scene and Oppenheimer's visions of the quantum world just made me more inspired. Five stars are not enough for this movie, neither are any stars and ratings in this world. This movie is out of this world and it is a masterpiece.


The costumes in this movie were simply amazing. The costumes were very well designed, and the colours were also amazing. It also played a huge part in the movie and helped Nolan out a lot by just contributing to making his visuals and imagination come to life. 

The sound effect was unbelievable. The sound effects + Cinematography and Visual Effects made me feel like I was in the room with all the characters when all the events occurred. The Trinity test scene was also amazing, I loved how Nolan expressed the nervousness of the scientists before and after pressing the button. 
I also absolutely loved the soundtrack of this film. Ludwig Goransson used a variety of instruments and tempos to convey the mood of the scene and the emotions of a character. The soundtrack enhances the film scenes and makes the whole film much more interesting to watch. Nothing in this world, no headphones, earphones, and speakers can be used to replicate my feelings listening to these soundtracks in an IMAX theatre.
The casting was amazing too. The actors were excellent in portraying the difficult emotions of their characters. Cillian Murphy was amazing at representing the emotion Oppenheimer felt during his hardships over the years. The supporting actors and actresses were also amazing at playing the supporting parts in this movie and acting out how their characters had an impact on Oppenheimer's life. 

If you have already watched the film and found it very fun and interesting, and if you want to learn more about how the film was made, I highly recommend you watch videos online regarding Christopher Nolan's method of making this film. I also recommend you watch interviews and the bts of this film as you may learn more amazing things about the movie and Nolan's way of filmmaking. If you want to learn more about the Manhattan Project and especially Oppenheimer's life, I highly recommend you read The American Prometheus as it is the book that Chris Nolan took the inspiration and information for this film. Although it is quite long, it is worth it. I also recommend you read the transcript of this film if you have time, as you can understand the dialogues and words better and check the parts and details you may have missed in the movie. The script is written in first person POV: Oppenheimer's viewpoint, which makes it more interesting to read, and it makes you feel like you are in the same room as the characters, even without visual effects.

I was amazed at the fact that Christopher Nolan did not use CGI for this movie. Almost everything was practical and CGI was only used to enhance the look. Nolan has already amazed the cinema society with his simply staggering practical effects that were huge and well-planned. Nolan used all sorts of creative ways to recreate the iconic Trinity Test scene and the unique visions of Oppenheimer. By watching the bts of Oppenheimer, you can see how determined Nolan is to bring a masterpiece to the table.
 
Some people may find this movie boring. If you hate movies based on history, have zero interest in science, or hate movies that require a bit of thinking and researching before and after, then probably this movie may not be for you and you might find the movie extremely _boring._ Of course, you should understand that everyone has different opinions and views about almost anything in this world so there is always a possibility that you may disagree with the things I have said here.
**Overall, this movie is a masterpiece**. As a fan of Noaln's films and Cillian Murphy's acting ever since childhood, this film couldn't have been better. I definitely recommend you see this, as soon as possible, and on the biggest IMAX screen possible because it would be worth it. Of course, if you dislike the kinds of films I mentioned in the previous paragraphs, I don't recommend you see this film. I want to thank the crew who have worked very hard on this project, I want to thank the actors who just showed a staggering performance, I want to thank Ludwig Goransson for his amazing soundtracks in this film, and of course, I want to thank Christopher Nolan for his dedication and his amazing film, I would like to call **his masterpiece**.",10.0
Oppenheimer,Christopher,"Well, was a interesting movie. But, the scene of the nuclear bomb i felt a little disappointed. Even when the credits start to show up i said: ""Wait, really the so trend nuclear bomb scene was what i saw in Los Alamos?

I imagined another bigger bomb and destructive!",
Oppenheimer,aarsheeb,"The movie is dramatic, thrilling and gives an insight of a true event that had happened in the past",
Oppenheimer,r96sk,"Yep, a quality film.

<em>'Oppenheimer'</em> lived up to the billing to me. Not that that was ever really in any doubt, with Christopher Nolan at the helm and Cillian Murphy in lead alongside all the acclaim that I have seen this receive since its 2023 release. The near 3hr run time is no problem whatsoever, despite more talk than anything else the film simply doesn't hold any slow/uninteresting moments - 'tis all fascinating.

Ever since I found out about his casting I knew Murphy would deliver a sensational performance and that's exactly what he produces here, which is not even a tiny bit surprising - anyone who has seen television's <em>'<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)"" rel=""nofollow"">Peaky Blinders</a>'</em>, for one, would know that. Loved every single second of him onscreen.

As for the rest of the cast, where do you start?! Emily Blunt is impressive, again not a shock as I'm a fan of her from other things - shoutout <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/the-adjustment-bureau/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Adjustment Bureau</a>'</em>. Matt Damon stars alongside Blunt in that aforementioned great flick, he himself is very good in this. Robert Downey Jr. shows quality too. All others have much less screentime but do a fair bit with it, for example Jason Clarke and Florence Pugh.

It was impossible not to be fully engrossed in this, at least for me. It is not my favourite Nolan movie, <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/inception/"" rel=""nofollow"">Inception</a>'</em> and <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/interstellar/"" rel=""nofollow"">Interstellar</a>'</em> surpass but to be honest it's the definition of splitting hairs as his films are of such a high standard. For example, <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/dunkirk-2017/"" rel=""nofollow"">Dunkirk</a>'</em> and <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/tenet/"" rel=""nofollow"">Tenet</a>'</em> move me less but are still ones I rate highly.

Oppenheimer,Dean,"Movie is extremely slow and boring. I'm not fan of Nolan's movies, but still decided to watch it since this movie won an Oscar and has lots of famous actors inside. I thought it would be good, but boy I was wrong!

First of all, there's this stupid annoying background music all the time during the movie, which is very distracting. Now add to this background music actors that talk almost like whispering. It's just horrible, but what's worst about this movie is that it is super boring and uninteresting and it's very long (3 hours). This movie is a total garbage, but since it's a Nolan's movie and has so many high profile actors it has big hype and high ratings, but don't be fooled. This is a pure trash. I regret I wasted 3 hours on this boredom.",1.0

Dune,Habenula,The worst movie I've ever seen. Don't waste your time.,1.0
Dune,Tsavo,"    As a child, I remember catching David Lynch’s “Dune” on TV. I was too young to really understand the plot at the time, but I didn’t care, all I knew was that the worms were awesome. When I got a little older, I read the book for my first time. It was the first “adult” book I read on my own, and I was in love with it ever since. I read it many more times growing up, and when the miniseries came out, I watched and recorded it every night, then re-watched it time and time again. When “Children of Dune” aired, I again devoured it happily. In the case of the Lynch film, as I grew, I of course began to see more and more of the flaws, though I personally hold the “Spicediver Edit” in quite high esteem. That particular cut of the film manages to make the Lynch version into what is a genuinely good film, but still imperfect. The miniseries has, up until now, remained my preferred adaptation. Now we have a new adaptation: Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune”, and it certainly is quite different from the previous two versions in many ways, but is it good? Well, at least from my perspective, that answer is complicated. The short version is yes, it is a good film, but it’s not a great one.

    The gist of the story is straightforward. Many, many millennia in the future, Paul, the son of the Duke Leto Atreides, finds himself and his family caught in plots of intrigue, and betrayal, after taking custody of a new and valuable planet. In order to survive, he finds that he will have to depend on the training of his mother, the Lady Jessica, the help of the planets local population, the fremen, and his growing awareness of a great, yet possibly terrible destiny that waits for him. 

    In reality though, the story is anything but. The novel is infamous for being “unadaptable” with its complex “plots within plots” storyline, along with its sheer size. There is simply too much going on in the story to make it easy to turn into a film, or even a series. The previous efforts have all brought different aspects of the novel to the forefront, and this new version is no different. In broad strokes, it is perhaps the most faithful to the novel in terms of themes, and it certainly emphasizes some aspects of the political commentary behind the novel, such as the missionaria protectiva, which was nowhere to be found in the Lynch film, and only really hinted at in the miniseries. They also spend a little more time focusing on the fremen and their sentiments toward off-worlders after living under the Harkonnen regime, but unfortunately, while it is nice to see these themes in the film, they are undercut by little development. In fact, the entire film suffers on that front. So much of the political context and scheming has been left out that the film as presented feels somehow empty. 

    Early in the film, it is established that the emperor considers the Duke Leto a threat due to his popularity, but never really explores too much beyond it. Even more strangely, the film establishes this, but then later makes it seem like they were never really certain about the fact that the emperor was involved in a key scene, unlike the book, where the Duke was fully aware that they were heading into a trap, and was attempting to outmaneuver his political opponents. The Baron Harkonnen is limited to a few admittedly atmospheric scenes where he more or less confirms the emperor is aiding him in their goal to destroy the Atreides line, but it is reduced to a few scant lines, the bare minimum necessary to understand the plot. This, unfortunately results in very shallow characterization, and the same problem runs throughout the film. Gurney Halleck, Thufir Hawat, and Doctor Yueh are all present, but each of them is only given a small handful of scenes, in which they only speak a few lines each, before they are forgotten to focus on Paul, or beautiful scenic shots. They never feel like fully realized characters in the film, more as brief supporting roles, whom are only present in order to fulfill their roles in the larger storyline. Thufir Hawat receives perhaps the worst treatment in this regard. Even the primary cast are not given a lot of development. We are given enough to know who they are, and a little of their personality, but nothing more. It seems strange, that the longest adaptation of the first half of the novel ever made should have less detail and character than either previous version. It does however, and it certainly hurts the film as a result. Long, moody shots are great, but only when they exist in addition with actual depth. The plot of the film has been streamlined to the point that it feels watered-down, and genuinely wastes the talents of its cast all stuck in roles that have been similarly effected. 

    There are also a few key scenes that actively go against things covered in the book. One scene features the Lady Jessica speaking of secretive matters regarding the bene gesserit sisterhood while sitting in the cockpit of an ornithopter right behind Thufir Hawat, whom would be easily able to hear everything she had just said. Another moment, involves the Reverend Mother Mohiam referring to Jessica as Leto’s “wife”, even though she would know full well that they aren’t married. Yet another moment involves that Shadout Mapes pulling out a crysknife to offer it to Jessica while out in the open, and Jessica is in the presence of guards. The Shadout later sheathes the knife unblooded, and those who have read the book will know why that choice does not work for the film, especially in the context of fremen later being shown cutting themselves before sheathing their knives. Of course, in any adaptation there will be liberties taken, and there are indeed more, but these three moments in particular certainly seem to stand out the most in regards to actively going against aspects of the original novel, and in doing so, hurt this film as an adaptation.

    With that said, there were things I liked as well. As I have stated a number of times, the film is gorgeous. There are a couple of scenes that certainly seemed to be more “style over substances”, such as a shot of ships rising from the ocean for… no apparent reason, but man do they look beautiful. There is also a very real sense of scale in the film that I can freely admit neither previous version ever accomplished. As a result, there are a few scenes that do far better match their description in the book, and are glorious to watch.

    I do really appreciate the way they portray the emperor, discussed, but never seen. A powerful force that can be felt looming in the background, his hand guiding everything happening. He is built up excellently, and I will be curious to see how well he is portrayed if we get a sequel. In the previous adaptations, he was prominently displayed and used to provide greater context for the politics of the story, but in the book, he is only ever seen in the end, and keeping book accurate in this case certainly works very well.

    The film also features the most book accurate version of Paul’s growing prescience, hinting at possible outcomes rather than complete premonitions. The way it is executed is not necessarily without its flaws, or heavy-handedness in a couple of moments, but it works well. Similarly, we also get the story of the bull and Leto’s father for the first time, though the film attempts to make the bull symbolic in a manner I am not sure really works, or is earned.　Also notable is the death of a significant character finally matching their death in the novel. 

    I have also stated that the cast does a great job, and I stand by that. In the entire film, there is not a bad performance in the film. My only complaint would be with the portrayal of the Lady Jessica, who comes across as too emotional, presumably in an attempt to show her ability to shift from being upset to being entirely refined and composed in moments, but that is a matter of writing rather than performance. When it comes to the casting, I personally felt that many of the actors matched their roles well, in particular enjoying the casting of Duke Leto and the Baron. I did not however care much for the gender-swapping of Liet, which served no real purpose, especially when one considers how small the characters role was in this version of the film, though Sharon Duncan-Brewster did a good job with what she had. I also did not care for the casting of Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica. While she is a very good actress, she seemed to me a bit too “girl next door”, rather than the character from the novel that the Duke Leto notes “reintroduced regality into the Atreides line”. 

    When it comes to the score, I will admit that I was not certain how I would feel in regards to Hans Zimmer’s work on the film. The samples I had heard up until this point had been interesting, but I was not sure how it would work in terms of the film itself. I can say that it works well, though there are moments when it feels almost as watered-down as the plot itself. It never really allowed me to feel excited at any point, but it did match the tone of the film very well, and I can easily see myself turning it on whenever I clean my house in order to set a “mood” (Ha! See what I did there?). 

    In conclusion, despite my criticisms, I did enjoy the film. I think it works well enough to be understood, though there may be some moments where the average viewer could find themselves feeling confused. It certainly is a visual spectacle, but one undercut by excessive trimming of detail and world-building. I hope it is successful enough to warrant a sequel in order to finish the story, but I also find that I will not be upset if it does not. As adaptations go, this is no “The Lord of the Rings”. In the end, I have to rate this version of “Dune” closer to the original Lynch film, and maintain the miniseries as my favorite adaptation of an amazing novel.",6.0
Dune,tahmid_007,Great movie with excellent BG music and visual effects. Waiting for part two.,
Dune,Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/dune-spoiler-free-review

""Dune sets the new standard for epic cinema with eyegamic visuals, powerful sound design and score, and a compelling story told surrounded by an absolutely massive scale.

Denis Villeneuve adds yet another audiovisual masterpiece to his filmography, despite some narrative-pacing issues due to the heavy exposition and repetitive yet crucial dream sequences. Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson stand out in a stellar cast, where everyone delivers performances no short of impressive.

From the remarkable character work to the constantly captivating interactions, without forgetting the spectacle of the riveting action/war scenes, the extremely layered screenplay is beautifully translated to the big screen, where every viewer should definitely go to watch this movie.

Finally, don't forget that epic sci-fi/fantasy films are quite rare, so enjoy them as much as you can when they come out, instead of worrying about the comparisons with other sagas.

There's enough space to love them all.""

Rating: A-",8.0
Dune,Mex5150,"I'll open by saying I am not a fan of Villeneuve. In fact, I think he's a hack whose only genuine talent is making stupid people falsely think they are actually quite smart. I am also a HUGE Dune fan. They have been my favourite series of books since I first discovered them as a teenager. So although I hoped for the best with this, I was expecting the worst. What I got was somewhere in the middle. It's an OK movie, not great, thankfully not terrible, but OK

It got some things right the 1984 Lynch version got wrong, but still somehow managed to get other stuff wrong (including stuff Lynch got right). It was also a surprise how much Villeneuve just lifted directly from the Lynch film, both visually and auditorily.

The wardrobe choices were a huge disappointment. If you didn't know the time setting, going just on the clothes in the new Dune you'd be forgiven for thinking it was set a mere forty or fifty years (if that) in the future rather than the twenty thousand years in the future when it's really set. The Lynch stillsuits look futuristic, unworldly, and something that really would keep you alive in the deep desert. The new desert wear looks like they are just going to go dirt biking for an hour or two in our present-day world.

The casting (completely ignoring the pointless gender swap) was good, However, with the exception of Paul, Chani, and Rabban the original casting was all better. But the original (apart from the odd decision to use the totally unsuited Kyle MacLachlan) was a masterclass in how to cast the perfect people for the role.

Anyway, enough of the comparisons, This film is about the first two-thirds of the first novel. I always thought the story would be better told via a big-budget TV series (or even mini-series) rather than a standalone movie. I still think what they tried to cover here was too much for a single movie, but it was a step in the right direction.

The film mainly sticks to the book story but does make some needless changes, the most obvious of which being the changes made to both the gender and story of Liet Kynes, which in turn impacts the story of Chani. Most other changes are small and mainly insignificant though.

The film being filmed in Norway, Jordan, and Abu Dhabi looks fantastic and very well suited to the large screen. And it's clear a great deal of time, effort, and money was put into the sets that looked equally good as the places they were meant to be.

The acting was of a suitably high standard, but unfortunately, many of the Dune names and terms were horribly mispronounced. That and the Hans Zimmer fart that is played constantly throughout the soundtrack is likely to pull people out of their emersion in the movie.

I was also somewhat surprised by what was left out, OK the source material is VERY dense and obviously some needed to be cut, but I don't really think it's made clear just how crucial melange is to the functioning of the empire and society as a whole. Also what (and why) mentats are is largely ignored, you may think that isn't overly important, but it is at the core of how many things are done in the Dune universe.

Over all, it's not a bad movie. Despite its flaws, I still think the 1984 Lynch version is better though.",4.0
Dune,Peter McGinn,"I enjoyed parts of this movie. But I seem to recall that I enjoyed reading the book this is based on (it was decades ago after all). And since I don’t remember the details of the source novel, I don’t know if it is the screenplay that dragged down my overall opinion or the original book.

I can sum up pretty quickly the pieces that disappointed me, and be advised they are probably spoilers.

I didn’t like how long it took to get our first glimpse of the spice worms, and even then they were represented as holes in the sand. Not exactly awesome. I didn’t like how they quickly killed off all the good guys except for Paul and his mom (okay, yeah that is definitely a spoiler). Plus I thought it weird that during the big battle scene we have awesome bombs and complex tracer missiles flying about, but on the ground we have merely well-choreographed hand-to-hand fighting with knives and swords. Couldn’t the folks who invented the missile come up with a pistol? Or am I being picky?",6.0
Dune,badelf,"I read Frank Herbert's book, Dune, when I was in high school and really don't remember it much except that it was great and a little scary. At that age, I probably didn't get the subtext message.

I never saw any movies of it so I decided to watch both the 1984 Dune by David Lynch and the 2021 Denis Villeneuve version sequentially. I'm going to talk about both of them here.

This may not be a popular opinion: Lynch's version is **brilliant** and the Villeneuve Dune is absolute **shit**. Here's why:

First, is the Villeneuve Dune slick? Yes, absolutely. I should hope so considering it's nearly 40 years after Lynch did his, for crissake.

Are the character's in David Lynch's version kitschy and over the top? Yes! That's one reason it's so much better! It's Sci Fi, duh! You watch Marvel movies and suspend disbelief for incredible, imaginary super powers? All of Lynch's characters are downright gritty and believable within this particular surreal fantasy.

By the end of the Lynch Dune, I had sympathy for nearly every character in the film. Even the villains caught my emotions. Paul Atreides character development was realistic and attractive.

Villeneuve's characters? I felt like my neighbor came over and asked, ""Hey, can you come to watch my kid's junior high school play?"" ""Sure, Denis, just let me fill my 1-liter flask with tequila first.""

Villeneuve's characters were so damned flat and lifeless that they evoked NO emotional response whatsoever. Although I occasionally sit through a bad flick, I can't remember recently watching a movie as awful character-wise, as the 2021 Dune. If I were an actor on that set, I would be silently screaming. How does a director even do this?

Oh, and where's the creativity? It's 46 years since George Lucas founded Industrial Light & Magic, and Denis can't create one single, new, goddamn space machine 46 years later? (One could argue the hummingbird copter is new, but it's not so creative when you realize that we didn't even know how hummingbird wings actually worked until this millennia.)

But here's the real clincher: the screenplay. David Lynch gave us a complete story. Sadly, he didn't have the final cut and disowned his film when the critics panned it. Despite the fact that Lynch is a true artist and genius, the studio took 45 minutes out of the film. 45 minutes! Even ruined by the studio, even 40 years later, Lynch's film has a clear vision and carries the timeless message that Frank Herbert intended. I would LOVE to see the original cut!

Villeneuve, on the other hand, stopped abruptly in the middle of the book. I now realize that Denis is not about the story. Denis is all about the franchise money, and that sucks. As a result of the bad screenplay, this 2021 version doesn't even carry the socio-political statement it was supposed to have. I want my 155 minutes back.

I don't watch Part 2s, especially when it comes to void-of-creativity and void-of-character-development Hollywood movies. You can take your bad franchise and shove it up your sci fi black hole.

Admittedly, I loved Blade Runner 2049, but this is so disappointing, I may never watch another Villeneuve film again. Do yourself a favor and see David Lynch's version of Dune.",2.0
Dune,JPV852,"This newest adaptation of the classic Frank Herbert novel (which I've never read) has the usual amazing visuals director Denis Villeneuve is known for alongside great cinematography from Greig Fraser (Rogue One, upcoming The Batman) plus the incredible and bombastic score by Hans Zimmer has the technical aspects but void of any real emotion behind the story and, especially, characters.

I couldn't find much wrong with the performances but nobody really wowed me despite having talents like Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Jason Momoa and Rebecca Ferguson, I didn't think anybody stood out, and that includes Timothée Chalamet in the lead role. I can't say this was at all bad and have some mild interest in part two, but, and this says a lot about Villeneuve's great career, this is one of his lesser films. I'll probably at some point give this another watch, especially when/if part two comes out (who knows when that will be). **3.75/5** (rounding it, I was debating 3.5 or 4, went with the latter)

On the plus side, it is much better than the 1984 adaptation.",8.0
Dune,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I was really eager to watch this movie and at the same time a wee bit concerned because I knew that I would be hugely disappointed if it turned out to be another movie massacring a classic source material.

I have to admit that it was a very long time since I read the Dune books but I have to say that the movie was mostly true to the books, as I remember them, and also reasonably free of agenda driven rubbish apart from the odd replacement of some characters with “gender correct” ones for no real good reason.

There is really not much point in me saying much about the story. It should be well known for any science fiction fan and it is a great story and really good material for a big screen movie despite some “critics” at Rotten Tomatoes moaning about it and calling it unwieldly etc. Probably too big a book with too many words for the small, agenda driven, brains of Rotten Tomatoes “critics”. No surprise there.

The movie as a whole is wonderful to watch, the scenery is oftentimes very beautiful and the décor, the buildings, the machinery is very well done. I was surprised that the world of Caladan was portrayed as a rather austere Scottish looking landscape but after getting over the initial surprise it worked very well actually.

I also like that the Harkonnen, especially the Baron, are not turned into some exaggerated comical figures but, although disgusting and despicable, they are actual humans.

Overall the casting was quite good and everyone played their roles well. At the beginning I felt that Paul was a bit too wimpy, from what I remember of the book he was quite well trained and skilled already from the start, but he picked up as the movie went along.

It is a science fiction, borderline fantasy, movie so there should be some special effects, right? This is a difficult movie to make special effects for since this universe is a weird mix between futuristic science fiction, fantasy elements and old-fashioned traditions.

I have to say that they succeeded quite well though. The atmosphere felt just right, ships, spice harvesters, buildings looked cool and fitting the story. The way they implemented the personal shields was very nice. They didn’t go overboard on special effects and weird designs. The ornithopter was of course totally ridiculous from a scientific point of view but at least it looked pretty cool.

If I should complain about something, although that is not the fault of the movie but of the source material, I have never understood how, in a universe which is obviously driven by hidden agendas, machinations and assassinations, the Atreides could just pick up everything, leave their home and put all their important eggs in one basket at Arrakis.

One more small thing that I could complain about would of course be that we now have to wait two years, from what I have read, until we get to watch the next movie to get to the part were the really cool stuff happens.

Bottom line, this was movie is definitely in there vying for the title “best movie that I have watched this year”.",10.0

Dune,Nathan,"_Dune_ was a massive undertaking due to the sheer amount of lore and political backstory director Villeneuve had to fit in a two-and-a-half-hour run-time, but I am happy to say it was executed brilliantly.

The story of _Dune_ is incredibly deep, there are so many layers of political factions and relationships that it can get quite confusing at times. I had to constantly be looking up specific individuals and their ties to each other to understand the minor nuances of the story. Despite that fact, Villeneuve is still able to deliver a coherent narrative that will allow the majority of the audience to understand the overarching plot. After the buildup of the first act, the story gets cooking, and I was utterly invested.

There is an incredible atmosphere present in this film. It begins as a Sci-Fi epic, following a house starting anew on a fresh planet and a new industry to conquer. You can feel the optimism and the sense of discovery in the shots due to the interesting angles, lighting, and a brilliant soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer. But as the narrative evolves so does the tone, as a thick fog of helplessness bleeds on to the screen and you can feel the dread form. This tone was quite refreshing in today’s blockbuster cinema, as each movie needs to incorporate a vast amount of unnecessary comedy to appeal to the broader audience. Dune is unapologetic about what the story is trying to deliver and gives you exactly what it wants without any concessions.

The visuals are stunning throughout the entire runtime. One of my favorite scenes was during the spice extraction visit. I loved the blend of realism that was used in this Science Fiction setting. The ships and equipment look like they could exist in our own world with a few technological advancements. The fight choreography is really well done, especially the hand-to-hand combat. The final scene was epic, each fist and punch were so sharp and calculated, it was really impressive to watch in the age of jump cut action.

The acting is perfect throughout the film, I really cannot point to any one character that felt off or out of place. Timothee Chalamet did an incredible job as the lead man. He delivered a heartfelt performance and evolved throughout the entire film into the confident leader the story crashendos on. Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, and Josh Brolin all did great jobs as well. I really brought the somewhat complex nature of Lady Jessic and Duke Leto, they had really great chemistry with themselves and with their son. Stellan Skarsgard had my favorite performance of the entire film. I felt entirely disgusted everytime he was on the screen, and he made the hairs on the back of my neck stand tall. He is truly a man poisoned by greed and will not stop at anything on his path to fortune. Jason Momoa does a fantastic job here too. I felt he really fit his role and his lines were delivered effortlessly, much better than his performance in the DCEU.

_Dune_ delivers a fantastic Sci-Fi epic that gave me everything I was looking for and I will be eagerly awaiting the sequel's release.

**Verdict:** _Excellent_",9.0
Dune,The Movie Mob,"**Overall : Dune creates a universe and characters at an epic scale similar to Star Wars. For sci-fi fans, cinema fans, and fans of incredible special effects, Dune is a must-see.**

Probably the most visually stunning movie of the year. I watched it first at home on HBO Max but had to see and hear it again in theaters when I realized this movie required a complete theatrical experience! The cast was top-notch, and the scale that Denis Villeneuve evoked in every scene was breathtaking.

Madame Web,CinemaSerf,"We start off with an heavily pregnant woman deep in the Peruvian jungle looking for a very rare spider with her pal ""Ezekiel"" (Tahar Rahim). Guess what? Yep - she finds it, and almost immediately too! Anyway, it turns out that her pal isn't so friendly after all and pretty sharpish she is shot and face up in a pool of healing waters where her baby is being delivered by a jungle people with spidey-skills. Advance twenty-odd years and we meet paramedic ""Cassie"" (Dakota Johnson) who drives around with her partner ""Ben"" (Adam Scott), indifferently saving folks from disaster. It's one such disaster, though, that sees her tumbled deep into the river and having to be rescued by her buddy. This trauma appears to trigger something weird. She is getting flash-fronts. She can see the tiniest snippets of the future - and that doesn't usually bode well for anyone, including her! A trip on a train to a funeral proves decisive as three of the other passengers also feature in her dreams - all being the targets of a mysterious lycra-clad tunnel-climber bent on slaughter. Can she rescue them and find out just what's going on? Well possibly, but the story is just thin and the characters so undercooked that I didn't really care. The whole arachnid story line is under-developed to the point that I couldn't see what her skills really had to do with a spider at all. Tahar Rahim seemed uncertain if he was supposed to be ""Deadpool"" and/or Antonio Banderas and hats have to come off to Celeste O'Connor for playing the entirely obnoxious and attitudinal ""Mattie"" with quite such aplomb. The denouement is straight out of ""Highlander"" (1986) and I'm afraid that rather summed this up. Not an original bone in it's small and squidgy body, over-scripted and made for the sake of it. Sure, it's all about team bonding, trust and finding yourself (quite literally), but the readiness with which all concerned buy into this increasingly repetitive and whacky scenario is just daft. Like the whole multi-verse concept, the studios have decided to take super-hero films and flog them to death without worrying about concept, character or a decent story, and though Johnson does try to lift this where she can, it's ends up being something akin to one of those ""Superman"" television episodes we used to watch with Dean Cain - only with monotonous time-shifting!",5.0
Madame Web,r96sk,"Ouch, that average rating! I'm not going to lie though, I genuinely had a fun time watching <em>'Madame Web'</em>... perhaps I should be keeping that fact quiet?

I don't know what to say, I found it to be suitably entertaining. I'm sure there are plot holes aplenty (I noticed a few) and it probably makes zero sense/isn't a good adaptation compared to its source material or whatever but honesty... I don't care, it gave me enough enjoyment that I wasn't questioning anything about what I was watching.

The cast are probably the key factors as to why I did enjoy this. I previously knew of Dakota Johnson but hadn't actually seen her in anything properly, I found her performance to be more than noteworthy and she spearheads the film strongly. The trio of Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor are positives too.

Tahar Rahim's antagonist, meanwhile, is poorly written and portrayed, though I personally thought the actor did a good job. I have no complaints with anyone who appears onscreen to be honest. Away from them, the pacing and score are also standouts.

In my recollection of viewing this, I truthfully haven't got any issues with it. If it wasn't for the slight bad murmurs that I did hear about pre-watch (though not much of it as I avoid as much as I can with movies) and the reaction on sites like this post-watch, I'd not be questioning my thoughts about this whatsoever.

""Wish is a magical journey about the vitality of personal wishes and the importance of pursuing those same dreams. Although the narrative follows a familiar structure and doesn't delve beyond the central theme, the nostalgia it evokes is certainly appreciated.

Ariana DeBose's powerful voice embodies the inspiring determination of the protagonist, leading a talented cast in a film marked by the beautiful blend of 2D and 3D animation, as well as original songs that, for the most part, win over the audience.

It's another charming chapter in Disney's vast library, offering a pleasant experience for fans of all ages.""

He rents some space in the barn of ""Eloise"" (Phylicia Rashad) and one evening she invites him round for supper. He arrives to find that she has committed suicide and a cursory investigation from her FBI daughter ""Verona"" (Emmy Raver-Lampman) reveals she was the victim of a callous scam that wiped out not just her savings, but $2 million from a charity she chaired. Yep, you've guessed it. ""Clay"" decides it's time to reactivate his account and get on the trail of these people regardless of just how high up the food chain the trail of complicity and corruption leads. Statham adopts a rather curious accent throughout this totally unoriginal and derivative action thriller that gets gradually more preposterous as it goes on. Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons add a little box-office to the thing, but their roles are undercooked and the former is actually pretty hopeless throughout. Some fun pyrotechnics and you wouldn't ever want to mess with ""Clay"" but these one-man assassination squad movies are ten a penny now and this is certainly not one of the best.",6.0

The Beekeeper,Chandler Danier,"I watched all the The ___ movies in preparation for the most expensive, The Beekeeper. It's short, snappy and dumb. Statham kills people like usual. Just a hard-working American bloke who only ever wanted to be cared for. If you feel all Australians are goofy and should die, you'll really like the end and probably rate it higher than I did.",6.0
The Beekeeper,MovieGuys,"Dumb as a brick. I'm sorry but the story behind this is downright moronic,  not helped by shallow or aimless characterisations, absurd action, empty dialogue and no real finale. 

In summary, a low IQ action flick that's stuffed full of empty exposition and little else.",4.0
The Beekeeper,r96sk,"I'm conflicted about <em>'The Beekeeper'</em>.

On the one hand, it's fantastic entertainment as Jason Statham plays a brilliantly badass character - every scene with him is top, top notch. The editing, action and score are positives, though everything around those aforementioned elements is annoyingly very hit-and-miss... and I'm not sure how much the other bits affect my enjoyment.

Away from the great Statham, the cast are also up-and-down. Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons are decent, I think inferior actors would've done much worse so those two do do well in fairness. Sadly, for Emmy Raver-Lampman & Co. on the FBI side of the story... not the best. I mean, they're OK but kinda boring at the same time.

Raver-Lampman's character is also quite lamely written, not the actress' fault of course but still. Without spoiling anything, I feel like her character should've been way more sympathetic to Clay's cause given the obvious - like, still 'do your job' absolutely but it's as if the character forgot what happened at the start of the movie.

The scummy organizations are also portrayed a bit too cartoony, based on what I've seen in real life about those sorta people is that they're usually lousy losers who happen to know how to do what they do - rather than 'Gen Z' (please do forgive me for using that term *shudder*) smartasses who party 24/7 as this 2024 release shows.

I'm happy with the rating I've settled on, Statham merited more though.",8.0
The Beekeeper,𝕽𝖎𝖈𝖍,"**The Beekeeper** is a serviceable action thriller that delivers what you would expect from a _Jason Statham_ vehicle: brutal fights, cheesy one-liners, and a simple revenge plot. The film is directed by David Ayer, who has a knack for creating gritty and violent urban settings, and written by Kurt Wimmer, who has a penchant for crafting absurd and convoluted sci-fi scenarios. The result is a mashup of John Wick, The Equalizer, and The Matrix, with a dash of bee-related humor and symbolism.

**Statham** plays _Adam Clay_, a reclusive beekeeper who lives on a farm owned by his elderly friend _Eloise Parker_ (**Phylicia Rashad**). When Eloise falls victim to a phishing scam orchestrated by a sinister tech company, Adam decides to use his skills as a former elite operative to track down and punish the culprits. Along the way, he encounters various obstacles and enemies, such as corrupt cops, hired goons, and a mysterious hacker known as The Queen (Ruby Rose). He also forms an unlikely alliance with Eloise's daughter, FBI agent Sarah Parker (**Emmy Raver-Lampman**), who is investigating the same case.

The film does not waste much time on exposition or character development, focusing instead on the action sequences and the spectacle. Statham is in his element as the stoic and efficient killing machine, dispatching his foes with a variety of weapons and martial arts moves. He also delivers some witty and sarcastic remarks, often involving bees or honey. The supporting cast is mostly forgettable, except for Rashad, who brings some warmth and dignity to her role, and Rose, who plays the villain with a mix of charm and menace.

The film's biggest flaw is its lack of originality and coherence. The plot is a generic and predictable revenge story, with some implausible twists and turns. The film also tries to incorporate some themes and messages about technology, society, and morality, but they are either underdeveloped or contradictory. For example, the film seems to criticize the dangers of data mining and online fraud, but also glorifies the use of hacking and surveillance by the protagonist. The film also uses the bee motif as a metaphor for Adam's identity and mission, but it is often inconsistent and superficial.

The Beekeeper is not a film that will challenge or surprise you, but it is a film that will entertain you if you are in the mood for some mindless and fun action. It is a popcorn flick that knows its strengths and limitations, and delivers on its promise of Statham kicking ass and cracking jokes. If you are a fan of his previous works, or of the action genre in general, you will probably enjoy this film. Just don't expect anything more than that.",9.0
Spaceman,Brent Marchant,"From time to time, a movie comes along that’s hard to define, and, hence, it’s hard to know what to make of it. Such is the case with the second feature outing from filmmaker Johan Renck, a director best known for TV commercials and music videos, a reputation that bleeds through at times in this production. Viewer opinions and interpretations of this one are all across the board, making “Spaceman” one of the most challenging releases to peg in recent memory. This space-faring sci-fi release tells the tale of an astronaut (Adam Sandler) on a solo, long-term deep space mission to investigate a mysterious anomaly. However, he’s experiencing a profound sense of loneliness that’s distracting him from carrying out his quest, in large part because of marital troubles with his pregnant wife (Carey Mulligan) back on earth. As he seeks to sort out these matters, though, he’s further sidetracked by the unexpected appearance of an enigmatic alien that resembles a large nimble spider (voiced by Paul Dano) who possesses a profound philosophical wisdom. But how will all of this shake out, and what effect will it have on the mission? This scenario makes for an intriguing premise, but what exactly is the filmmaker’s intent in carrying it out? There are mixed tonal aspects here, some of which seem sincere, with others that come across as cheeky and cheesy, as if the director is giving the audience a good, sidelong wink. Indeed, it’s often difficult to tell which way the narrative is supposed to go. And, if straddling the fence is the real intent, it doesn’t quite work. So where does that leave us? I suppose it’s up to viewers to decide for themselves, but that seems shamelessly noncommittal. Based on the film’s attributes alone, there are good arguments for and against this offering. For instance, its ample metaphysical and philosophical insights are cogently presented and easy to understand, even if a bit saccharinely encrusted at times. It also represents a promising step up for Sandler’s attempt at reinventing himself as an actor in search of more substantive roles than the inanely silly parts he’s best known for. And the picture’s numerous deftly placed allusions to other sci-fi/fantasy projects enhance the narrative nicely, as seen in homages to “Interstellar” (2014), “Solaris” (2002), “Everything Everywhere All at Once” (2022) and even the lyrics to David Bowie’s Space Oddity. However, tedious pacing, occasionally poor sound quality and less-than-stellar visual effects (especially in the alien’s supremely tacky appearance) get in the way, further adding to the inherent overall ambiguity noted earlier. This one is thus up to you – and don’t be surprised if you come away from it with a different interpretation than what’s written here.",6.0
The Boy and the Heron,Manuel São Bento,"MORE SPOILER-FREE MINI-REVIEWS @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/mini-reviews-2023-edition

THE BOY AND THE HERON is a visually captivating film that struggles to balance all of its storylines and themes. Technically, no faults. The visuals are nothing short of breathtaking, with each shot meticulously detailed and rich in storytelling. The animation is a true work of art, drawing viewers into a world of wonder and magic. The sound design and score complement the visuals beautifully, enhancing the overall viewing experience. And finally, the film retains the typical Ghibli humor that fans have come to love, sprinkling lighthearted moments throughout the narrative.

However, Hayao Miyazaki succumbs to his ambition. The filmmaker tries to incorporate too many ideas, resulting in a somewhat confusing, messy narrative, particularly in the transitions between different characters, locations, and story arcs. THE BOY AND THE HERON stumbles in its attempt to juggle multiple ideas, but overall, it still manages to deliver a delightful, enchanting experience for fans of the studio's work.

Rating: B-",6.0
The Boy and the Heron,CinemaSerf,"Maybe it's sacrilegious to say, but I didn't love this latest from the marvellously imaginative mind of Hayao Miyazaki. It follows the adventures of ""Mahito"" who arrives at the home of his factory-owning father amidst WWII. We appreciate quickly that his mother has died and that he is to have a new, expectant, mother in ""Natsuko"". When she mysteriously disappears and ""Mahito"" finds his presence ""requested"" by an enigmatic and beautiful grey heron, he strays into an old abandoned tower on his family estate and is soon embroiled in a world inhabited by people who are alive and, well, not! It seems the heron is not quite what it seemed, either, as he must explore rooms within rooms and endless doors that open into new scenarios. Pursued by giant pelicans, how can ""Mahito"" find his stepmother and return safely to their home? Luckily, along the way, he encounters the benevolently spiritual ""Kiriko"" as he finds himself the subject of some clever manipulation between the outwardly benign ""Grand Uncle"" who draws the power of life from a giant sacred stone he wishes to leave in the custody of our young explorer and the ambitious ""Pelican King"". You simply cannot fail to admire the vivid imagination of Miyazaki - the ideas and apparent randomness of the threads that gradually come together is hard enough to follow sometimes even when you have seen the denouement, and that's what makes these intricately drawn and characterised stories usually more intriguing and enjoying. Somehow, though, this was just a little too unstructured and meandering for my little brain. I've seen it twice now and maybe I just didn't engage with ""Mahito"" in the way I did with ""Howl"", ""Totoro"" or 'Chihiro"" or, indeed, with the story. It's still a glorious watch on a big screen and is certainly well worth watching. Just not sure it is in his top five, though!",7.0
Lights Out,MovieGuys,"Comes across as an unconvincing remake of the Jean Claude Van Damme movie Lionhart, from 1990.

Van Damme was in his prime when he made this film. The idea of him as an up and coming fighter made sense.Not so much so, in this reviewers estimation, when the lead character is a 58 year old ""street fighter."" Its a shame too, as I really like Frank Grillo. 

In any case, unsurprisingly, the fight scenes feel awkward and unconvincing. Even Scott Adkins, who I believe, would have made for a more credible lead in this role,  can't save this action, martial arts, pot boiler.

In summary, a poor story, questionable casting decisions and generally crummy fight scenes, leave little to be desired. Lights Out, indeed.",4.0

Out of Darkness,CinemaSerf,"So a group of Stone Age wanderers are searching the bleak wilderness for a new home when they begin to suspect that they are being stalked. Noises in the woods unsettle them, but they see nothing. Suddenly, though, one of their number is taken and the leader ""Adem"" (Chuku Modu) must make some difficult choices to ensure the survival of both his son and of his pregnant wife. The denseness of the Scottish forestry along with some creative use of light, shadow and audio goes some way to keep the film interesting but the plot itself is really weak and the actors - perfect teeth, skin, leather clothing that wouldn't look out of place at a gay pride gathering - all deprive the thing of any sense of menace or grittiness. It's difficult to watch without thinking the production caravan is just three feet out of shot! The redeeming feature may be an impressibly natural performance from Safia Oakley-Green (""Beyah"") but I'm afraid for the most part, I struggled to remain engaged and the ending, well that was just rushed and a little disappointing too. I would still suggest you watch it, if you get the opportunity - but on the television is fine and don't expect to be scared.",6.0

""Ricky Stanicky cleverly uses a blend of light humor, simple yet sincere messages, and a pleasant narrative to provide broad entertainment, as well as a testament to the complexities of personal growth and human nature.

The standout performance of John Cena, along with a cohesive and dynamic cast, elevates the film beyond its conventional plot, highlighting Peter Farrelly's ability to create stories that resonate with the audience through laughter and reflection. Despite the divergent opinions on Farrelly's contributions to cinema, his talent for balancing comedy with deeper thematic elements is once again laid out for everyone to appreciate, some more than others.

Recommended for all types of viewers.""

Freelance,Hooman Shahidi,Great movie!,
Freelance,CinemaSerf,"Hilarious that on the day Amazon announce the introduction of ads (or a 35% uplift in your monthly fee) that this nonsense hits the small screen. It purports to be a comedy, but I'm not sure what language you'd have to be speaking in order to get any humour out of this contrived and weakly devised action ""thriller"". Journalist ""Claire"" (Alison Brie) hires security specialist ""Mason"" (John Cena) to accompany her on a trip to a jungle dictatorship where she is to interview the president. Upon arrival they meet the suave and debonaire ""Venegas"" (Juan Pablo Raba) who has his own golden gun - a little less subtle than that of Christopher Lee! Anyway, no sooner do they land than they find themselves caught up in a coup led by an ambitious but cowardly nephew and must now traipse through the jungle trying to stay one step ahead of the military and of the mercenaries who may or may not be on someone's side! This is just a badly conceived mess of a film with the mediocre acting matched only by some dreadful dialogue amidst a repetitive series of ambushes, shoot-outs and a denouement that rather summed up this confused and derivative story. It's too long, but I'm not sure where you'd stop cutting if you started, so I'd have to recommend that you just go find an episode or two of the ""A Team"" and sink some Malbec instead.",5.0
Miller's Girl,bonniemoseley@me.com,"Miller’s Girl is an exceptional movie that shows two people crossing a line that leads to inappropriate behavior and devastating consequences. The movie has extremely complex characters, a wonderfully written plot, beautiful cinematography, great music, and keeps you trying to figure out whether these characters are good or bad. I love the dialogue between the characters. The writer/director lets the audience decide how they feel about the characters and their behavior. Many of the scenes are left unanswered. The audience has to decide what they think happens, and the meaning behind the final scene. I highly recommend this movie.",10.0
Bob Marley: One Love,r96sk,"It's fine, just nothing all that memorable.

I had a pleasant enough time viewing <em>'Bob Marley: One Love'</em>, though it does kinda seem a bit hollow post-watch - as in I don't feel like I've learned much nor actually seen that much, the movie has like three noteworthy events but then that's kinda it. The music from those involved also didn't feel amazingly utilised, I guess they didn't want it to be too jukebox-y.

Kingsley Ben-Adir does well in the lead role as Bob Marley himself. I'm not a Marley superfan or anything close, I basically only know his biggest hits, but the resemblance of Ben-Adir seemed off to me - a thought that was only solidified when the real Marley appears via archive footage at the end. Perhaps that's just me, though.

Lashana Lynch gives a good performance, spearheading the rest of the cast who are alright; interesting to see James Norton, Michael Gandolfini too... even if I didn't realise it was Gandolfini until the credits. Overall, it does feel like the film only scratches the surface of Marley's life. I wanted more from it, but to be fair it is still a decent flick in my opinion.",7.0
Bob Marley: One Love,CinemaSerf,"Sadly, this is one of those films that shoves almost all of it's best bits into the trails. What's left is a curiously sterile representation of the life of this vibrant and visionary man. To be fair, Kingsley Ben-Amir does turn in quite a charismatic performance, but the rest of that characters are largely under-cooked and seem there to make up the numbers. We get little by way of establishment. Why is he revered on his home island of Jamaica at the start? We are plonked into the centre of a political hotbed and then all to briefly, bullets are flying and we are in London, his family in Delaware. Again, little meat on the bones of context there for us to understand just what was going on and why he was so important to both sides in that conflict - alive or dead. The last twenty minutes does allow for more of his musical talents to shine, and KBA delivers them enthusiastically and engagingly, but somehow I just felt this was the thinnest of coats about his enigma. James Norton just looked like he was along because he liked the music and Lashana Lynch is totally unremarkable too. Son Ziggy may well have had a hand in this, but it really under-delivers on a story that I thought should have been a no-brainer politically, musically and culturally. Sorry, this is just a rather disappointing chronology that skirts across his life like a stylus on well worn vinyl. Pity.",6.0
Bob Marley: One Love,Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/bob-marley-one-love-review-a-sanitized-homage/

""Bob Marley: One Love navigates the intricacies of biographical storytelling with mixed success. Its commendable focus on Marley’s message and music, coupled with good performances, highlights the enduring relevance of his legacy.

However, the reluctance to engage with the more contentious aspects of his life and the oversimplification of his political contributions undermine the potential for a more nuanced, complete exploration.

While the movie serves as a vibrant homage to Marley’s spirit and artistry, it ultimately leaves me yearning for a deeper, more critical study of the complexities that defined one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.""

Five Nights at Freddy's,MustachedMovieMan,"I don't really get what all the negative reviews are about.
It's not the best movie ever or that I've seen this year, but I still had a good time watching it. The story was interesting, it had some scary parts, some humorous parts, lots of tension, was well-acted, well-shot, and the effects (both practical and CGI) were well-done. Also, the production design and creature design was great.

A movie doesn't have to be restricted to either being ""the best"" or ""horrible."" The theater I saw it in was packed, the audience was responsive and seemed to be loving it, and I myself enjoyed it.

I didn't really play the games, but I was definitely engaged in the lore of some of the MatPat Game Theory videos I saw. And I could tell from audience reactions that there were some cool things in the movie if you knew the games. That's not a negative, to be clear. It's always really cool when filmmakers put things in movies that true fans would catch and geek-out about.

As far as being a viewer who didn't really play the games, I enjoyed the movie. And while I think knowing the games/lore would have definitely enhanced my enjoyment and enthusiasm, I wouldn't say it lacks as a movie or that the games are ""required viewing"" for those who haven't played them. Everything's explained pretty well.

As far as the horror aspect goes, it is PG-13; I saw some reviews complaining about the lack of gore... It's PG-13. C'mon guys.
But, that being said, I thought they still did a good job with the horror elements that were present.

I also really liked the trio of main characters. I thought Josh Hutcherson, Piper Rubio, and Elizabeth Lail all did a good job.

Five Nights at Freddy's,CinemaSerf,"Didn't Josh Hutcherson used to be famous? Well here he is reduced to the role of the struggling brother of ""Abby"" (Piper Rubio). Their aunt (Mary Stuart Masterson) is determined that this hapless bag of bones isn't fit to look after the young girl - after he takes out a visiting father in the fountain of a shopping mall and gets fired; so ""Mike"" has to get another job! Opportunities are thin on the ground, but there is a vacancy doing the security night shift and an old, derelict, pizza parlour. How hard can it be? Well a meeting with the enigmatic police officer ""Vanessa"" (Elizabeth Lail) should have rung alarm bells, and when he has to take ""Abby"" there for one overnight shift - well it's soon clear that this place has secrets to keep and that it knows how to manipulate the hopes and fears of ""Mike"" and his sister. Can they stay sane and focussed long enough to survive this maze of malevolent mechanical bunnies? I'm afraid the presence of Matthew Lillard never helps a film, and here is no different - this is just a rather nonsensical attempt at a spooky mystery that certainly has nothing to make you jump. Rubio is actually quite decent, but there's isn't enough else happening to compensate for the very slow build up, surfeit of dialogue and frankly rather silly underlying premiss. I suppose as Halloween gets bigger and bigger, we are going to get more and more of these mediocre offerings - but despite it's more prominent cast, this just belongs on the Horror channel at 2am.",5.0

Five Nights at Freddy's,ViolettSmith,"Five Nights at Freddy's is a fun bad film. I personally loved it. I've waited years for it to hit the big screen, and I can't believe the day came. To get this out of the way, Jim Henson's company did a fantastic job bringing the animatronic horrors to life. All the animatronic suits look phenomenal; it looks like they ripped them straight from the game. The Easter egg characters also looked really good. Jim Henson's done an awesome job! The actors for the film were great as well: Josh Hutcherson, Elizabeth Lail, and Matthew Lillard. All great actors that fit their roles perfectly. I am a little sad that Matthew Lillard's role, William Afton, didn't have that much screen time. For being the main villain of the whole film, he only had a big twist at the end. Speaking of the big twist, Matthew Lillard played William Afton perfectly; I can't imagine someone else playing the role. He tuned into who William Afton was so well. The line ""I always come back"" didn't really fit; at that moment, how does he know he will come back? The lack of scares in the film and the fact that Mr. Cupcake gets the most kills in the whole film are insane to me. FNaF is a jumpscare game, and this film focused more on the human story, which is fine; I would've liked more than a few jumpscares.

Writer Tina Fey appears as the calculus teacher but fails to impact much as the thing just meanders along ticking every box and beating just about every stereotype to death before the anthesis of all things obnoxious - a spring ""prom"" - brings things to an inevitable conclusion. Rapp can sing, and she knows how to take this stage-suited concept and belt out a song or two, but the rest of this really does remind me of one of the latter editions of the tired ""Glee"" project.

The Zone of Interest,Lachlan Thiele,"<b>INT. LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS - NIGHT</b>

Auschwitz is the location of the world's most unforgivable crime — where humanity lost itself. An area forever marked with the horrors of xenophobia and a story that filmmakers continuously attempt to display on the screen. While holocaust cinema isn't being worked into the ground like other genres, there hasn't been a breath of fresh air for a while. 

<i>The Zone of Interest</i> is that breath.

From the get-go, you're engulfed back into Auschwitz, except in this film, there is a gorgeous house bordering the concentration camp. Immediately this large grey wall hiding the atrocities is juxtaposed with the family's beautiful garden, which their mother wishes to continue improving, never mind the continuous screaming and low rumbling furnace in the area. What <i>Johnathan Glazer</i> does with the sound design of this film is incredible; through audio alone, you're left with a sense of dread; how could you sleep when all you can hear are screams? The film opens with a black screen and an audio scape, immediately setting the tone.

""The Zone of Interest is one of the most memorable, remarkable films of the last few years. Jonathan Glazer achieves a fascinating dissociation between the general tone of the movie and the mundane actions of the protagonist family, portraying the unbelievably shocking global apathy in the face of the greatest crime in human history.

An extremely complicated viewing, excruciatingly frustrating, full of negative emotions, and not very accessible to the general public. The atmospheric, static cinematography, together with the powerful score and especially the background sounds that will haunt any viewer, justify the use of the term ""masterpiece"" to technically describe the film.

The Zone of Interest,CinemaSerf,"Christian Friedel is quite effective in his portrayal of the Nazi commandant Rudolf Höss here. He and wife Hedwig (Sandra Hüller) offer us one of the most stark contradictions I think I've ever seen on screen. The beautifully manicured garden of a delightful family home with an unique next door neighbour. That would be the Auschwitz concentration camp of which he was in control. We follow his selection to run the place, his increasing role in implementing the extermination processes and then gradually, as he is promoted again, their realisation that the idyllic life they want for themselves is doomed. It's the brutal comparisons that work best here. We don't really see anything graphic on screen, that's all left to our already well enough developed imagination. The blissful ignorance of their children, the ample supply of food and the prevailing attitudes that nothing at all is amiss compares frighteningly with the real life ghastliness of those just a few feet across a large concrete wall. I suppose it could have more meat on it's bones - maybe just a little too much is left to our own interpretation and it can be a little slow at times, but it still delivers well as a template for just how many people thought the mass killings was hardly more important than whether or not they'd run out of eggs. It's not an history lesson - there are corners cut and licence is certainly taken with some of the timelines, but it's still a poignant look at human behaviour that's well worth a watch.",7.0
The Zone of Interest,Brent Marchant,"Some movies just have to be seen, even if they make for a difficult watch, and writer-director Jonathan Glazer’s latest is one of those pictures. While this offering is at times a bit uneven, when it’s on, it’s on, leaving a powerfully indelible mark on viewers, one that you feel in your gut and your heart and can’t get out of your mind. The film tells the unnerving story of the family of Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss (Christian Friedel). They reside directly next door to the infamous Nazi concentration camp, somehow managing to live seemingly “normal” lives in the shadow of this horrendously notorious facility. What’s most chilling, however, is that the family seems largely oblivious to the atrocities taking place on their doorstep, focusing more on their social activities and material possessions instead, even with the routine sounds of gunfire and the sight of billowing smoke from mass crematoriums filling the surrounding skies. In portraying this, the filmmaker doesn’t need to resort to graphic, gratuitous imagery to make his point about the unspeakable acts unfolding so close to home; comparatively simpler depictions of these events (and their aftermath) speak volumes instead, creating some of the most implicitly unsettling sights ever captured on film. As a consequence, this approach really makes one wonder how anybody could be so wantonly callous and unfeeling, making for truly troubling viewing. Yet it’s also the kind of imagery that has to be seen for its full impact to sink in. This Oscar nominee for best picture – and the recipient of numerous other competition and film festival accolades throughout awards season – richly deserves the attention it has garnered, even if it’s an inherently disturbing watch (sensitive viewers take note). To be sure, there are some pacing issues that could stand to be rectified, and a few story threads could use better clarity, but the picture’s superb cinematography and fine performances by its excellent ensemble cast (especially Sandra Hüller as the commandant’s self-absorbed wife) are undeniably noteworthy. This might be a film that no one wants to screen – but that everybody nevertheless should.",7.0
The Zone of Interest,Cinema_Snobb,"Even in the middle of a war, there are two world's that exist side by side.  One of ever day life.  Raising kids.  Working a job. Gardening. Having lunch with friends.

Yet...over the wall is horrors.

Rudolf Hoss is a commandant at Auschwitz during World War II.  His wife Hedwig, played by Sandra Huller, and his children all live in the family homes over the wall from the camp.  They live a normal life, and Hedwig prides herself on the beautiful flowers and swimming pool to enjoy. 

And just over the wall Jews are be incinerated.

When Rudolf gets a transfer, Hedwig's life goes into turmoil at the thought of leaving the lovely home she loves.

And just over the wall Jews are being incinerated.

There's a haunting scene that shows the results of Hedwig's gardening.  It shows close-ups of the all the different flowers and plants that have been lovingly been cultivated.  They are stunningly beautiful.  In the background the sounds of barking dogs and screaming and yelling can be heard.

And just over the wall Jews are being incinerated.

There is so much about this film that is disturbing.  It presents an angle to the war and the concentration camps that I haven't seen before.  We often forget about ""normal"" life going on at the same time.

Huller is excellent, just as she was in ""Anatomy of a Fall"".  The film is leisurely and quiet.  It doesn't show the horrors of what is going on next door, but it doesn't need to since those horrors permeate every scene.  One of the biggest horrors is actually how people can go about living their every day life with exterminations only yards away.",9.0
The Zone of Interest,BornKnight,"The Zone of Interest is a 2023 historical drama film written and directed by Jonathan Glazer, loosely based on the 2014 novel by Martin Amis, that based herself on the life that Rudolf Höss, Nazi commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp from 1940-43 must had in that time in his residence, just at the side of the camp.

It premiered at the 76th Cannes Film Festival, winning both the Grand Prix and FIPRESCI Prize. For the 96th Academy Awards, it received 5 nominations (including Best Motion Picture, Best International Feature Film, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound) - for me best sound is almost a win, and have great chances for best international movie and adapted screenplay.

Both Christian Friedel as Rudolf Höss and Sandra Hüller (from Anatomy of a Fall) as Hedwig Höss are exceptional in their roles.

It focus on the idyllic live of the Nazi commander, in his house on the most normal life conditions, while the Holocaust and the killing machine he created works at just some meters of distance. 

The camera focus on medium and large plans, often showing the life of the dreams, but on the horizon we often see signs of the terror like smoke from the locomotives and from the enormous chimneys at the distance.

We also have other signs, extremely subtle, like the sound of shouts and shots at the background, that only shows as more close in rare sequences.

Other sequences like the girl, shoot in Infrared that left at night apples and fruits for the camp workers are just haunting (and the cause of one of the more aggressive shout sequence I mention above).

Interesting enough is the view as close the view of the  concentration camp is on the movie in the past, and in the present as a memorial. Both are unmistakable, but in either vision a far cry from what the reality must have been inside them. 

For the movie is a 8.6 from 10.0 / A- and a must see for 2024.",9.0
The Zone of Interest,MovieGuys,"The Zone of Interest takes the notion of the ""banality of evil"", back to its true origin, the family home. 

All human evil starts with a home. In this instance, the home of a concentration camp commander, Rudolf Höss, of Auschwitz and his family. The laid back ease of middle class family life, of an upper management level Nazi, is juxtaposed with suffering of people (Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, political dissidents, religious minorities and yes even some allied soldiers, who were prisoners of war), who quite literally reside, over the fence, in the concentration camp, Hoss oversees.

This is a quietly horrifying film where the an idyllic and wholly familiar family setting is punctured, by the occasional sounds of misery and death, emanating from neighbouring death camp. Smoke stacks, burn human remains, that rise beyond the family fence line. In another compelling scene, a Hoss family riverside outing is disrupted by human ash, floating with the waters current.

The Zone of Interest is not an demonstrably violent film. Violence is hinted at and as we can see, is psychologically and physically partitioned off, from the peaceful home life, of Hoss and his family. 

This is a compelling film but I did feel it overplayed its hand somewhat with discordant music and oddly dissonant night vision scenes, with a girl apparently trying to help the victims of the camps, by leaving food for them, at work sites, concealed next to their tools. 

In summary, a disturbingly influential film, that looks openly and honestly, at where evil resides.",8.0
Anatomy of a Fall,Lachlan Thiele,"<b>INT. THE ANATOMY OF ANATOMY OF A FALL - DAY</b>
<i>Anatomy of a Fall</i> is an excellent film crafted from the mind of Justine Triet. It's beautifully acted, shot, scored and edited together. So let's look at the Anatomy of <i>Anatomy of a Fall</i>.
 
Story:
The story revolves around the unconfirmed cause of death of <i>Samuel</i>, who has fallen out of his attic window. The only person in the house was his wife <i>Sandra</i>, <b>Sandra Hüller</b>, the prime suspect. Their son <i>Daniel</i>, blind from an unfortunate event, is the only witness. The story is from the perspective of <i>Sandra</i>, and just like any courtroom drama, details are revealed over time. Fortunately, it's at a steady pace, never announcing too much or too little, giving us the correct information at the right time. While I'm mostly positive about the story, some moments slow right down, and we come to a standstill; overall, thanks to the following few components, they considerably make up for the story's flaws. 

Performance: 
Its lead is <i>Anatomy of a Fall's</i> greatest asset, <b>Sandra Hüller</b>. She is tremendous, pulling no punches in the role of Sandra, the deceased's wife. For the rest of the cast, no one except the dog is ever greater than Sandra! 

Cinematography: 
The camera in this film is on a swivel, always moving, keeping us engaged. The camera uses Visual humour quite a bit, which is always great to see. Finally, the colour grade felt natural and, at times, warm, giving a homely vibe. 

Score:
A simple piano piece plays throughout the film; it is excellent. 
Finally, the editing:
This was a stand-out for me. It was cleverly cutting at points to hide us from the horrors but holding onto moments before it became too much. 
There's a lot of love about this film — a highlight of the Cannes 2023 run.

Anatomy of a Fall,CinemaSerf,"When young ""Daniel"" (Milo Machado Graner) returns from a walk in the snow with his dog (""Snoop"") he discovers the body of his father lying on the snow in front of their alpine house. He shouts for his mother, writer ""Sandra"" (Sandra Hüller) and soon the police investigation is out to establish just what happened. What do we know? Well, not a lot really - just that before the young man left for his stroll, his mother was giving an interview in their kitchen to a journalist that was being increasingly drowned out by the intrusive music emanating from her husband upstairs, and - that young ""Daniel"" is blind. ""Sandra"" enlists the help of a friend who represents her as after many a re-enactment the authorities conclude that there is enough evidence that she lobbed him over the balcony and murdered him. A curiously relaxed courtroom drama now ensues. Those of us used to watching British or American scenarios like this might find the approach, usually entirely speculative, taken by prosecuting counsel to essentially draw his own conclusion from evidence that may or not be there is quite entertaining to watch. The President of the tribunal rarely intercedes in what becomes a frequently unsubstantiated analysis of the sometimes turbulent marriage of the two, we learn of the cause of the boy's blindness, of his mother's sexuality and by the denouement I felt that Justine Triet had worked well with a strong cast to create a whodunit where there might have been no crime at all! That denouement is a little rushed, but leaves a lovely degree of doubt in the mind of the one member of the cast who probably needed convincing the most! It's just a shade too long, a wee bit too much build up, but once it's in full swing this is a strongly performed, sometimes quite funny and dark crime drama that is well worth a watch.",7.0
Anatomy of a Fall,Brent Marchant,"It’s always disappointing when a film aspires to greatness that it never achieves. Such is the case with the latest offering from French writer-director Justine Triet, whose allegedly suspenseful thriller is about as appetizing as a plate of tepid leftovers. This crime investigation/courtroom drama about the mysterious death of a middle-aged unsuccessful writer (Samuel Theis) who falls from the second story of his mountain chalet looks into whether his demise is due to suicide or murder, with his wife (Sandra Hüller), herself a best-selling author, being the prime suspect. Despite an intriguing premise, however, the movie is overlong, needlessly talky and inherently flat, with a cold, clinical, unengaging narrative and characters who engender no connection, compassion or empathy. In essence, this is a “whodunnit” that plays like an extended “whocares.” Fault the screenplay here, which seeks to tell a tale in the same gripping vein as such great courtroom dramas as “Anatomy of a Murder” (1959) but that never achieves the level of tension, mystery and audience engagement needed to pull that off. The meticulously orchestrated script feels calculated and derivative virtually from start to finish, especially in its trial sequences, which explore an array of possible motives and explanations, including everything from infidelity to plagiarism to previous suicide attempts, that rely on often-implausible speculation and inflated conjecture to carry forward a proceeding that probably never should have ended up in court in the first place. What’s more, the double entendre that is the picture’s title is so obvious that any hopes of nuance, subtlety or profundity evaporate quickly once the failing nature of the couple’s troubled relationship surfaces. While the film admittedly features a fine performance by Hüller, it’s far from enough to rescue a picture with big aspirations that never pan out. How this release has garnered so much exaggerated awards season buzz is beyond me, especially given its intrinsically insipid, underwhelming, overstated character. There are plenty of other films of this ilk out there that are far more worth watching than this one, so grab one of those better selections instead and give this one the well-earned pass it genuinely deserves.",6.0
Anatomy of a Fall,BornKnight,"French movie with a drama / courtroom theme that is gripping more into it's realistic tone than others movies that create unexpected and unbelievable tones, directed by Justine Triet from a screenplay she co-wrote with Arthur Harari (Onoda: 10,000 Nights in the Jungle).

Currently it is the winner of Canne's Palm D'or and nominated for five Academy awards, being those Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Achievement in Directing, Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, Best Original Screenplay, Best Achievement in Film Editing. 

It tells the story of In an isolated mountain chalet near Grenoble, where the problematic couple French Samuel Maleski is playing music in his attic so loudly that interrupts an interview of his German wife, Sandra Voyter (played by Sandra Hüller), and son Daniel (partially blind), returns from a long walk with his guide dog Snoop to find Samuel dead below his attic window. 

From there and all the theories, criminal analysis and courtroom judicial processes guide the movie and gain the midia of the country. Do not expect CSI level invention on this one - it is logical and reasonable as a movie that analyses the crisis in the couple and the impact on the son with a heavy focus on the courtroom that gabs your attention.

Sandra Hüller is the protagonist that leads with an incredible performance on her role. The direction is solid as well as the screenplay. The cinematography varies from formal takes to more active ones and the editing is perfect in joining all the takes.

I usually found courtroom movies to be boring but this wasn't the case that holds your attention till the end even with the slow moving of events and investigations from the live of protagonists to the dispute of the lawyers.

A strong contender for all the prizes but knowing the academy I am almost sure it will grab 2 to 3 prizes.

From my point of view the movie is a 8,5 out of 10,0 / A. For sure one of the movies of 2023 that must be seen, so it gets a like from me too.",8.0
Dream Scenario,Brent Marchant,"Packing a lot of material and ideas into a single film can result in a muddled, confusing mess, no matter how well-meaning a filmmaker’s intentions might be. However, in his third feature outing, writer-director Kristoffer Borgli succeeds for the most part when it comes to tackling such an imposing task. This offbeat tale of tenured but underappreciated university professor (Nicolas Cage) takes viewers on a wild ride through the diverse realms of fame, metaphysics, cancel culture, unrelenting group think, and unexpressed, underpursued desire, and the downside consequences of each. All of this comes about when the middle-aged everyman protagonist inexplicably begins showing up in the dreams of countless people, many of whom he doesn’t even know. This curious oneiric anomaly – an inspired metaphor for one’s presence on social media and in the public eye – quickly transforms him into an overnight viral media sensation, one that starts off with a generous showering of attention and lustful admiration but that almost as quickly leads him to become a scorned put-upon pariah. He swiftly becomes more than just yesterday’s news; he turns into the object of a targeted campaign of cancel culture, hate speech and unapologetic ostracism. And, ironically, it all stems from something he never wanted nor asked for in the first place (at least in the form it ultimately took). From the foregoing description, it might sound like the filmmaker has tried to overstuff this vehicle with far too much material for viewers to process and comprehend, and there are points in the story (especially in the last half hour) where a good case could be made for that argument. However, in telling this allegorical fable, the director manages to keep the narrative’s ideas distinctly sorted and in context to drive home his message, a powerful cautionary tale about the point we’ve collectively reached as a society with respect to these powerful and potentially damaging matters and practices. These are notions that we all need to hear but seldom do because of all the noise surrounding us that prevents us from hearing the music because of all the notes. For all this seriousness, however, “Dream Scenario” is loaded with hilarious, laugh-out-loud humor and fine performances all around (especially Cage and Michael Cera as an empty-headed, self-absorbed brand management expert), complemented with skillful film editing and carefully selected incidental shots that effectively punctuate the mood of many scenes. The script is generally solid, too, though it begins to stray somewhat from the material that works best in the final act, and there are a few graphically violent sequences that sensitive viewers should be wary of. On balance, though, this is the kind of production that should be made in greater numbers in an age where so many of us have lost touch with reason, our existence and ourselves. Maybe watching an offering like this could help us all sit up, think and get back on track while we still can.",8.0
Dream Scenario,CinemaSerf,"When college professor ""Matthews"" (Nicolas Cage) starts appearing in the dreams of strangers (oh, and his wife!), his whole life is turned topsy-turvy. Initially it's all a rather benign phenomenon with his appearances fleeting, inconclusive and harmless. Until, that is, he meets one person who has been having a rather more intimate experience. Not only does this meeting not go very well (on various levels!) but it seems to change the very nature of the illusions for everyone, turning them more into nightmares... A predictable, occasionally violent, backlash ensues which makes the man's life - and that of his family - all but insufferable. What to do now his fame has come back to bite him? I quite enjoyed the first half hour of this quirky and entertainingly written drama. Cage is always rather good at taking the rise out of himself, and he seems to be enjoying the ride at the start. Once the story turns a bit darker, though, it runs out of steam. It's charm and uniqueness becomes rather subsumed in a rather unsubtle whack at the ""cancel culture"" that exists amongst those who live their lives via social media. It's not the first or the best to draw a parallel between what's real and what's fact - even when such distinctions are easily identifiable, and after a while I felt the film had no clear idea of how to conclude without actually proving it's own, rather depressing, point. The idea is interesting, the delivery is fine - but the end product is all a bit underwhelming.",6.0
Dream Scenario,BornKnight,"It must be not the most original movie but hey, it is something unexpected. Being from A24 I did what I do on almost all movies - didn't read anything about it beforehand. 

After watching the movie and taking my conclusion, I researched a bit about it: it is a black comedy movie from the norwegian (ok strange film spoiler) Kristoffer Borgli produced by Cage and Ari Aster. Ok, this also got my attention: the director has only 3 movies with this one, being the last one ""Sick of Myself"" (2022) literally the opposite of what this one talk about - a satyre of cancel culture in a mildly surrealistic way (maybe there also enters a pun later in the movie about France). 

He is a normal biology professor that starts popping into millions of people dreams and gains notoriety just to be the the fruit of nightmares and start to be cancelled by the society.

The base of the acting is the ""good actor version"" Nicolas Cage as Paul Matthews, a college professor and Julianne Nicholson as Janet Matthews, Paul's wife. Other recognized actors like Michael Cera in minor papers. 

The cinematography by Benjamin Loeb (""Mandy"", 2018, ""Pieces of a Woman"", 2020, ""After Yang"" 2020) is very effective especially in the use of angles. On the soundtrack, that is very adequate without any music other than OST the last music (credits one) City Of Dreams by 
Talking Heads is very nice.

But the real deal with the movie aside from the theme and story is Nicolas Cage in another good role, Thanks God for that.

On my score, not a movie for everyone, only those who enjoy northern Europe cinematography, a solid 7,5 out of 10,0 / B+ - I am sure you can call the story something you've seen before.",7.0

That vision might just have forgiven this film had he featured a bit more, but clearly he had read the derivative script and decided it only merited one filming day - hence he hardly features at all.

The family decide to move into her father's house - he is now in a care home - and quickly the youngest discovers a bear. Yep - a teddy bear. What can go wrong? Well it isn't a very nice bear, indeed it's distinctly malevolent and is soon trying to lure all of them (except Tom who has fled the proceedings by now) into a parallel reality with lots of rooms containing lots of scenarios. Some benign, so less so. Poor old ""Jess"" is soon at her wits end but fortunately neighbour ""Gloria"" (Betty Buckley) is on hand with some pearls of wisdom that might help them through this rapidly menacing quagmire! Or will they? This film plays out exactly as you would expect. There isn't an original bone in it's body, the acting is mediocre at best - but wait, it's nowhere near as banal as the extracts from the Janet & John book of horror film writing. Some of the dialogue here really does have you staring at the cinema ceiling in disbelief. It's another standard Blumhouse offering that passes the time without you having to engage your brain in the slightest - in fact, you could just watch the last ten minutes and miss very little from the rest of it.",5.0
Imaginary,r96sk,"Pyper Braun merits praise, <em>'Imaginary'</em> otherwise falls flat.

I was never locked into the story and I didn't really care for the characters at any point, even Braun's Alice isn't all that interesting despite a rather great performance from the young actress. DeWanda Wise is a bit dull, while Tom Payne disappoints somewhat - I mean he only has a small role, sure, but his acting is unconvincing... and I know he can actor far better, as seen during his time on TV's <em>'<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)"" rel=""nofollow"">The Walking Dead</a>'</em>.

The antagonists in this are poorly utilized, the poster bear is prevalent but very boring. It needed a Chucky-esque portrayal, rather than the blank stare we get every few minutes. The ending also drags, I thought it was going to end sooner a few times but it kept finding new ways to stick around; nothing majorly grating, granted. The score is at least OK.

It also, amusingly, took me ages to work out what the bear's name was. I'm not familiar with the name ""Chauncey"", so genuinely for the longest time thought the name was either ""John C"" or ""Shaun C"". It was only when I finally noticed it written down visually that I realised! 😂

In conclusion, credit to Braun but everyone else onscreen and off it could've done better in my opinion.",5.0
Perfect Days,BornKnight,"Coproduction between Japan and Germany, directed by the german director Wim Wenders (Texas Paris, Wings of Desire among others) and written by him and Takuma Takashi.

It won the Cannes Film Festival 2023 for Best Actor and Ecumenical Jury

It tells some days at the life of a public bathroom cleaner at Tokyo, interpreted by Koji Yakusho Hirayama, as Hirayama, his daily routine and 4 events in between his usual days. It also shows how some people treat those invisible workers even in a modern civilized country as Japan.

Hirayama have a simple, but happy life as he is and what his does with the maximum commitment - it is a marvelou movie about contemplation and what simple things and events can bring of happiness in the life, if you allow it.

The cinematography is by Franz Lustig (Anselm), and it is beautiful in using the available light and daily variations, mostly in shots with the protagonist.

With a slow minimalistic story focused on this philosophy and camera work also directed to the architecture of public bathrooms, it may not be a movie for everyone.

One Life,Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/one-life-bfi-london-film-festival-review-a-must-watch-important-wwii-story/

""One Life is yet another important story from WWII that deserves to be seen on the big screen.

Despite not breaking genre barriers, it unfolds its narrative in a captivating manner, packed with devastating, bittersweet moments, but also filled with wonderful depictions of altruism, humanitarian sacrifice, and hope, culminating in a powerfully cathartic ending that serves as an ideal tribute to Sir Nicholas Winton.

The cast carries the weight of the responsibility of the rescue mission with grounded care, relying on the legendary Anthony Hopkins to bear the explosion of the accumulated emotion.

Beautifully edited, tear-inducing score... simply a must-watch.""

Rating: A-",8.0
One Life,CinemaSerf,"Johnny Flynn performs quite well here as the young stockbroker Nicholas Winton who arrives in Prague just as the Nazis annexe the Sudetenland. He is horrified by the child poverty that he sees and decides, perhaps naively, to work with his British Refugee Council colleagues to try and expedite their removal to a safer and altogether earthier environment. Fortunately, his mother Babette (Helena Bonham Carter), herself from immigrant stock, is no slouch when it comes to doorstepping officials in Whitehall and soon has convinced the authorities to agree a fast-track mechanism that will enable him to get the children back to the UK provided they have guaranteed foster homes and the fairly massive sum of £50 as a guarantee. He returns to London and a massive public awareness/fundraising campaign ensues - as do eight trains carrying over six hundred children to safety. We are told this story via a series of flashbacks from the modern day Winton (Sir Anthony Hopkins) who now lives peacefully with his wife Greta (Lena Olin) in Berkshire. He is perusing a scrapbook he has left in a drawer for forty-odd years in which he has photographs and details of many of those passengers on the ""Kinder"" trains. His friend from back then (Jonathan Pryce) manages to put him in touch with Betty Maxwell - the wife of the wealthy publisher Robert, and next thing he is on British television's most popular ""That's Life"" programme that regularly reached 18 million people on a Sunday evening. This appearance poignantly introduces him to one survivor, his next sees that snowball into some sixty or so who owed their life and liberty to the efforts of Winton and his colleagues - whom he is always very clear to ensure are never forgotten. I recall watching this programme back in the day and the dramatisation is no less moving than the original broadcast. Sir Anthony offers us a considered performance - demonstrating a shy family man who rejects the trappings of fuss and celebrity because he sees his behaviour as nothing special. Doing the right thing. His efforts are touching and understated and nicely dovetail with the rather pushy and forthright Bonham Carter fighting tooth and nail against red tape in 1939. As an insight to Nazi tyranny it also works subtly. We see very little actual violence, but we see a squalor and hopelessness that robs the soul of hope as depressingly as the situation robs their stomachs of food. The film looks good and is sparingly scripted allowing our own imagination to do much of the thinking here.",7.0
One Life,r96sk,"A touching picture featuring Anthony Hopkins.

<em>'One Life'</em> is <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/schindlers-list/"" rel=""nofollow"">Schindler's List</a>'</em>-esque, though perhaps more of a grounded portrayal of such events without the proper Hollywood-ness drama that that aforementioned flick holds; no hate on that sensational Steven Spielberg production by any means, it's a far better film in fact. This 2023 release is very hearty though, one of those movies where it is impossible not to care for the people onscreen.

There are plenty of emotional scenes that touch the feels, with one involving Hopkins right at the end particularly hitting. That man is excellent throughout, as expected. Johnny Flynn impresses too, he is just as important here as the Welshman. Helena Bonham Carter is a little underused, especially given she's on the cover, but very good. Neat to see Jonathan Pryce appear, also.

I actually remember seeing that real <em>'<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That%27s_Life!"" rel=""nofollow"">That's Life!</a>'</em> clip randomly on YouTube many years back and I didn't realise until just before it's portrayed here that it was reenacting that exact moment.

Sound of Freedom,EmmanuelGoldstein,"As someone who was a victim of child sexual abuse myself and as someone who admittedly likes Trump (who praised this movie to no end) and also as a tiny bit of conspiracy nut and seeing all the mainstream media attack this movie and trying to smear it, I really, REALLY wanted to like and support and even praise this movie - but I just can't.

I have to admit that it's a bit difficult for me to agree with the mainstream media's warning about this movie, but they really are correct for once - sometimes they throw you curve balls like that. I mean after all, there was a time when I trusted the mainstream media and I lost trust in them not because they were mainstream, but because they just started to get a lot of things wrong. But that also means that if they get things right for once, I can't just categorically disagree with them.

And it's really not like they are just smearing this movie for no good reason. They do (for the most part) have a valid point. This movie does nothing to actually stop this crime or to help the victims or to help people recognize this crime when they see it. On the contrary, because it claims to be based on true events, it causes people to have a completely wrong impression about this and therefore makes it harder for people to detect it when it's happening, because this movie is less accurate in its depiction of the real world than a Liam Neeson action thriller. Actually, Liam Neeson's recent film ""Memory"" was pretty good and actually much more accurate in it's depiction of child trafficking than this movie.

Because this movie really does nothing but reinforce outdated and completely wrong stereotypes. This type of thing isn't something that mainly happens in South America or in ""other"" countries and children don't just get kidnapped out of the blue by complete strangers and against their will. The sad truth is that most cases don't involve a stranger at all, but someone the child trusts and the child isn't gonna come running to you begging for help, cause the truth is they are victims of years of extremely systematic and sophisticated psychological manipulation.

And the perpetrators aren't all tough guys either. Actually a lot of them are quite educated, sophisticated and female because they don't raise suspicion. And also it's not just about forcing the kids to make movies - that only plays a very, very small part, but this movie would have you believe that that's the main part - that's the smallest part by far! Most of the aspects involved are MUCH worse than ""just"" that. 

And as much as I would love to think that there are plenty of officers (official or rogue) of government security agencies who are incorruptible and ceaselessly fight the ""bad guys"" in relentless sting operations, the reality sadly isn't as clear cut. Yes, sometimes SOME children do get rescued, but actually very rarely by police, much less government security agencies. Well, there was that ONE case in Bosnia where a policewoman and member of an international agency uncovered a human trafficking operation - but then again the people running it were her colleagues...",1.0
Sound of Freedom,Wuchak,"**_Sorta “Taken 4,” but starring Jim Caviezel and focusing on children enslaved by sex traffickers_**

A Homeland Security agent (Caviezel) in SoCal tracks down people involved in child pornography, but he decides to leave the agency to save children trapped in sex slavery, starting with a little boy from Honduras. He teams-up with a former cartel accountant (Bill Camp) to track down the kid’s sister in which he must eventually infiltrate a camp of Columbian revolutionaries in the Amazon jungle.

Made in 2018 but not released until 2023, “Sound of Freedom” is based on the real-life story of Tim Ballard, the founder of Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.). It features actual footage of children being captured by slavers on CCTV. Imagine a more gritty-realistic version of the “Taken” movies, with Liam being replaced by Caviezel, and that’s this film.

This is a well-done, eye-opening picture about the perverted human cockroaches amongst us, but it isn’t entertaining in the conventional sense for obvious reasons. It amusingly became anathema to Lefties, also for obvious reasons.      

The flick runs 2 hours, 11 minutes, and was shot in Cartagena, Colombia with additional scenes done in Calexico, California.

Sound of Freedom,CinemaSerf,"Though at times I felt luck played a bit too much of an hand in this drama, it's still quite a potent telling of the story of dedicated real-life agent Tim Ballard (Jim Caviezel) who spent much of his time working for the US Government trying to thwart the activities of people traffickers. More specifically, of those odious and venal monsters who kidnap and trade in young children who are destined to populate the sex industry and end up drug addicts and diseased in the process. When he rescues a young boy from such a scenario, he discovers that his sister was also taken - and the youngster and his father implore Ballard to try to find her too. Impossible, you might think - but a lucky break points in the direction of a lawless area of the Colombian jungle where even the local army doesn't go. Working closely with a man with quite a murky past and now his highly useful general factotum Vampiro (Bill Camp), they head off, disguised as doctors, into the wilderness. Can he locate her? Can he rescue her and get out alive? No, there's not oodles of jeopardy about any of that - but this film really does use this seemingly impossible mission to shine a light on these disgusting practices that still thrive in ostensibly civilised, Christian societies. Cavielzel is on good form here offering us an hybrid of adventure and action coupled with a highly developed moral compass. Camp, likewise, delivers quite a charismatic effort and local copper Jorge (Javier Godino) adds an extra dimension proving that the Colombian authorities found this practice just as revolting as anyone else. It's not brutal nor particularly graphic, it just allows our own imagination to put two and two together here and is a really effective indictment of a behaviour that truly turns the stomach. From a creative perspective, the photography - especially in the jungle - is first rate and all-in-all this is a thought provoking enterprise that's well worth two hours of your time.",7.0

""Lisa Frankenstein marks my first disappointment of the year.

The youthful cast wholeheartedly embraces their campy roles, infusing deliberately exaggerated emotions and expressiveness for an evening of light entertainment with the promised levels of blood and 'macabreness'.

Sadly, the screenplay lacks the same commitment to the absurd, resulting in tonal and thematic inconsistencies throughout a narrative less imaginative than anticipated. The ensuing indifference and uncertainty regarding the film's point and message leave a bittersweet taste...""

Lisa Frankenstein,BornKnight,"Horror-Comedy (not the opposite) directed by Zelda Willians in her full feature film, and written by Diablo Cody (Juno, Jennifer's Body) that tells the story of a grief stricken teenager who had her mother slaughtered, and lives now with an abusive mother-in-law and a lovely sister-in-law.

Kathryn Newton as Lisa is perfect for her role.

Stigmatized by her past and actions the is the black swan of the school, and passes a lot of time in a old cemetery (watch the credits animation closely) of the 19th century on a tomb of another teenager that died with a green lighting into 1837.

The movie emulates the 80's teenage romance-comedies (it passes in 89), in a light way till a certain previsible point - for sure it isn't as sugary as you may think to those who wonder. And have an unsuspected ending.

Lisa Frankenstein,CinemaSerf,"""Lisa"" (Kathryn Newton) is a bit of a loner who lives in one of those second families where her rather feeble dad (Joe Chrest) has married the rather vain and odious ""Janet"" (Carla Gugino) who has a friendly daughter ""Taffy"" (Liza Soberano). At school, she has taken a shine to floppy-haired heart-throb ""Michael"" (Henry Einkenberry) and he seems to be a little interested too. Might romance blossom? Suddenly a lightening strike changes everything. The long-dead occupant of a grave she habitually sits beside when she is reading (Cole Sprouse) is electronically reinvigorated and finds his way into her home, her wardrobe and now, as with ""ET"", she has her own secret creature in the closet. Thing is, there are bits of her new friend missing - his ear, his tongue, his hand (that's not a comprehensive list!) - so the ensuing escapades mix science with comedy and some good old doses of vengeance as they try to restore him to his former, piano playing, glory. It could have been much more fun, this, if it had committed to the audience one way or the other. It's clearly gone for a wide appeal and so compromised on the darkness and adult nature of the humour. Many of the scenarios - especially at the the rather brutal and eye-watering conclusion, could have worked so much better had Zelda Williams aimed the movie more at those who could appreciate the dark comedy rather than dilute it down to something akin to a frat-comedy. It's better than I was expecting, and Newton does fine as the film progresses, it's just a shame it didn't really know were to go or who it was for.",6.0
Lisa Frankenstein,r96sk,"There are glimpses of goodness, though so short they don't hide the film's frailties.

<em>'Lisa Frankenstein'</em> is, in my opinion, a disappointment. I can kinda see what they were going for and at times I could appreciate it, but all in all it doesn't really work for me. I will say the pacing isn't actually that bad, the film went by relatively quickly. The two big weaknesses to me were the dialogue and simply the story in general, both are rather quite dull... if they weren't, I may have enjoyed this.

The cast are one of the film's more positive features. I like Kathryn Newton, I remember thinking she was great in the similarly underwhelming <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/freaky/"" rel=""nofollow"">Freaky</a>'</em> from 2020, and she does try with what she's got to work with here. Carla Gugino is possibly the standout, I would've liked to have seen more of her. Liza Soberano is alright, while Joe Chrest plays a literal continuation of his Ted Wheeler.

I will say that I felt the film did slightly improve towards the end, just not enough for me to say that I had a good time watching it unfortunately. I got to see this in <em><a href=""https://letterboxd.com/r96sk/list/watched-in-an-empty-cinema/"" rel=""nofollow"">an empty cinema</a></em>, which is always nice.

The Iron Claw,r96sk,"<em>'The Iron Claw'</em> is quite the depressing watch!

A lot of the story you can see coming from a decent ways away, even for someone like me who previously knew nothing about this family, but that only adds to the tinge of sadness that is present in the film from pretty much the get-go. The film does a grand job at making sure that events onscreen move along at a good pace, especially as some parts could've (but don't) felt repetitive if told differently.

There's an excellent showing from Zac Efron in this, such a great performance from that man. I also appreciated Holt McCallany, as well as the likes of Jeremy Allen White and Harris Dickinson. The Von Erich family are portrayed well, though it is a shame that I read that they left out brother Chris - I do get the reasoning as to why, but I feel like they should've found a way to at least acknowledge his existence.

All things considered, though, this 2023 release is tremendous. Highly recommended.",9.0
The Iron Claw,CinemaSerf,"Oh well, looks like I might be in the minority here - but what is all the fuss about? A domineering patriarch (Holt McCallany) is determined that all four of his sons will succeed in a wrestling ring where he didn't. His sons ""Kevin"" (Zac Efron) and ""David"" (Harrison Dicksinson) are destined to work for a shot at the world title, ""Kerry"" (Jeremy Allen White) for Olympic glory and finally ""Mike"" (Stanley Simons) - the more creative, musically minded, one brings up the rear. President Jimmy Carter and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan puts paid to the Olympic ambitions and so now the three siblings can work together to climb the rankings in Texas and maybe earn a shot at the world title. Meantime, plastic Zac falls in love with Pam (Lily James) and it's at their wedding that Kevin discovers his dad's favourite (David) might not be doing so well. Tragedy ensues, indeed an whole slew of tragedies follow the Von Erich family as their dogged pursuit of glory causes the family to reel from one disaster to another - without anyone seeming to learn from it! Now as family dramas go, it's a sad story - no doubt about that. As a piece of cinema, it merely marries a fairly mediocre script with living proof that the spirit of method acting is alive and well. Certainly these men have put their bodies through the mill, and the fight scenes do impress - but none of the rest of it looks or feels real. Their characters are under-cooked, the dynamic between the boys and the parents, their mother (Maura Tierney) especially, is scarcely addressed and by the time we reach the historically accurate conclusion, I found myself completely devoid of sympathy or empathy for a family that had no grasp of what was important. There's a touching line at the end about brotherhood, but it was all just too little too late in a story of obsession and ambition that just didn't engage me at all.",6.0
Turning Red,garethmb,"The digital animation geniuses at Pixar are back with “Turning Red” and it marks a departure for the studio known for the “Toy Story” and “Cars”, franchises.

Set in 1990s Toronto, the film centers around 8th grader Mei (Rosalie Chiang), who considers herself an adult at 13 and eagerly applies herself to school when she is not helping her family tour business at a local Temple or hanging with her friends.

Life comes crashing to a halt when after a traumatic day of embarrassment; Mei awakens in the form of a large Red Panda. In a panic, Mei attempts to hide her situation which causes her over-protective mother to assume it is Puberty related and that her hormones are kicking in.

Mei desperately wants to get her life back to normal and learns that as long as she is calm her Panda is under control. However, this proves to be harder than expected and soon Mei learns that the Panda is the result of a family bloodline but there is a way to end it during a Lunar ceremony in a couple of weeks.

Chaos soon follows as Mei struggles with her situation and must find a way to cope with the changes that are going on and make some very important decisions about her life and her future.

The film is a difficult one to review for me as never having been a teenage girl dealing with puberty, raging estrogen, and the issues that go with it.  That being said the film struggles to find a balance as it tacks on the capers of Mei in Panda form without being overly funny or charming and keeps the focus on Teen Angst, puberty-related issues and becoming an adult.

The film lacks the interesting characters, charm, and appeal that have set the foundation for so many Pixar films and it is surprising that a company that can elicit a range of emotions in an animated short fail to really connect with their latest feature. There were some amusing parts but the film as a whole was rather dull and lacked much in the way of humor and was very predictable.

The decision to put the film directly on Disney+ as the studio’s recent “Soul” and “Luca” was raised some controversy but in the end, I do believe it was the right decision as “Turning Red” is not likely to be a film that draws people to the cinema beyond the opening weekend.

It is a film that is a bold step for the company, but one that lacks the charm and humor of previous films as not everyone is going to want to sit through a feature-length film on teenage angst and dealing with changing bodies and the emotional turmoil that follows.  However, the target audience is likely to connect with the characters and it will be interesting to see what the reaction to the film is long-term.

""Turning Red is undoubtedly the riskiest, possibly the most divisive work in Pixar history. Without any remorse or restraint, Domee Shi and Julia Cho unapologetically approach the sensitive topic of (female) puberty in a quite shocking, positively impactful manner.

A narrative that unquestionably explores the hormonal, emotional, and sexual developments of its characters, conveying a message of self-acceptance and understanding of human evolution through its metaphors loaded with youthful excitement.

With the well-known technical attributes from the successful studio, this film will serve as an essential companion for all pre-teens who will deal with or are going through this inevitable and ""inconvenient"" phase of life.

Turning Red,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**Pixar discovered anime and is looking to conquer the eastern box office.**

I had some expectations regarding this film. I don't know exactly what I expected, but I think everyone will understand if I say that the film is signed by Disney and Pixar, two studios with an enviable track record of successes. However, as soon as the film ended, I felt that I wasn't exactly the target audience for this film: male, over thirty, European, with little connection with pop culture or the anime world.

The film follows a young teenager, daughter of Chinese parents, in a somewhat cathartic experience in which she transforms into a friendly red panda. The film focuses on this transformation and turns it into a metaphor for a transformation called puberty, a discovery of one's own individuality and autonomy, particularly with regard to the relationship with one's parents.

The film is good, but the theme is… complicated. If it is absolutely true that most teenage girls will see themselves in some of the adventures that Mei experiences, it is no less true that many parents and guardians will face the topic with discomfort and raise some objections regarding a certain “apology of rebellion” that the film suggests. On a positive note, it was the first time I saw an animated film aimed at young audiences that addressed menstruation bluntly. The dialogues continue to insist, however, on that stereotype of the panicking teenager and the mother disturbed by the moment and insisting that, now, her daughter is a woman. This is stupid and conveys inaccurate ideas: a woman is a woman from before birth, from a biological point of view, and becomes a woman from a psychological and social point of view long after her first menstruation, when she begins to be old enough and mature enough to make their own decisions (the same applies to men, with the necessary reservations). In addition to these problems, the plot seems a little incipient to me, following paths that are quite obvious, opting for predictable solutions and creating basic characters. I could even talk about the amount of stereotypes about Chinese and Orientals present in this film… but do I need to talk about that?

The best thing about the film is the animations and the extraordinary quality of the drawings and effects. Pixar does not miss the opportunity to defend its credits and reputation in digital animation and offers us a feast for the eyes, with a realism and attention to detail that is difficult to overcome and that makes us think about the way technology has evolved in just a few years: “Toy Story” isn’t even thirty years old yet, and it already seems a little dated! Just one problem: I'm not a fan of anime at all. I think it's a very stylized, excessive, exaggerated type of animation. Unfortunately, this film adopts too many elements that are imported from the anime. Look at the eyes, the exaggeratedly large mouths, the sudden changes in the characters' poses or attitudes... you can't have one foot in two worlds at the same time.",6.0

The Inventor,CinemaSerf,"I was quite nervous at the start here when I saw how many production companies were involved - it looked like a recipe for a mess. Well it isn't. It's certainly an amalgam of animated styles featuring everything from flat 2-D drawing to complex technical sketching and some stop-motion characterisations that really worked quite quirkily. It's the briefest of potted histories of the life of Leonardo da Vinci. We start in Rome where his sponsor - Cardinal de Medici - is constantly firefighting for him with Pope Leo X who wants him to do something a little more useful, and not dissect dead bodies in the middle of the night! It's that latter habit that sees him flee to the relative safety of King Francis I of France. The King wants the maestro to build him a castle, or a new city, or some fancy weapons - or probably all of the above. Leonardo doesn't really react well to commissions though, and soon his new benefactor is also beginning to lose his patience. Luckily, he has the princess Marguerite in his corner, and gradually the grudging support of their mother, the Queen. It can look a bit disjointed at times, the art is frequently quite contrasting - but that just makes the whole proposition a little more interesting and innovative. The drawings reminded me a little of the opening titles to Tom Riley's ""Da Vinci's Demons"" television drama - and the narrative emphasises quite engagingly the visionary nature of a man who quite literally walked a fine line between science, religion and a bonfire! It's probably twenty minutes too long, but once we get going there is plenty of imaginative action to keep it watchable.",7.0
Past Lives,Brent Marchant,"As the son of parents who were childhood sweethearts/soul mates, I tend to be a sucker for movie romances that address this subject. In this case, however, the only “sucker” aspect applies to the money I plunked down to watch this two-hour snoozefest. Writer-director Celine Song’s debut feature has been praised as a masterful piece of filmmaking and one of the best pictures of 2023, but I heartily beg to disagree. When a pair of young, tightly knit Korean friends, Nora (Greta Lee) and Hae Sung (Teo Yoo), part ways from their native Seoul and are later reunited in New York after a 24-year separation, the reunion of these childhood pals provides them with an opportunity to reflect on what might have been. However, their time together consists mostly of a series of overly bloated pregnant pauses, inane dialogue and missed chances to discuss much of anything meaningful, the kinds of scenes that make even the most patient viewers want to yell “Get on with it already!” These “conversations” come nowhere close to matching their joy of their spirited youthful interactions or the heartfelt, substantive talks that later take place between Nora and her husband, Arthur (John Magaro). The result is, quite frankly, a big fat bore that’s trying to be more than it is but never achieves that outcome. Perhaps the biggest problem with this is the film’s truly sincere but decidedly paper thin narrative that doesn’t have the writing support to bring it all into beautiful full bloom, despite some fine performances, exquisite cinematography and an emotive background score. From this, the director would appear to have a hefty reserve of potential stashed away, at least based on this offering’s stylistic elements, but the substance could use some definite shoring up. Let’s hope her next effort lives up to that.",4.0
Past Lives,badelf,"Wow. For a director, Celine Song, just coming out of the gate, this is quite an impressive film. The lead actress, Greta Lee, fit the role like a soft leather glove, which speaks volumes, both for her talent, and for Song's casting. Lee's Hollywood Critics Association Best Actress award is well-deserved.

Song wrote an excellent screenplay, and her direction turned it into a stunning film. Kudos to A24 for taking a chance on her. I presume they are happy with the outcome. It's rather interestingly paced in a Buddhist or Asian kind of way - slow, meditative, and more is shown than is said. Overall, it's not a perfect film, but it's close.

This isn't precisely a coming-of-age movie, but the plot revolves around that (perhaps even more difficult,) developing period between the ages of 20 and mid-30s. I've held a long-standing belief that our life chapters change every seven years. You know: there are seven chakras, seven days in a week, the Seven Sisters (Pleiades), or whichever mystical seven you'd like. Over the course of three of these ""theoretical"" chapters, this movie focuses on two relationships in the protagonist's life, from roughly twenty-one (7*3) to approximately forty-two (7*6). She was married at about the time of a chapter shift (7*5), as if to validate my weird belief. In my world, it all makes sense.


This movie is certainly somewhat autobiographical, even by Song's own admission. It will be added to my Directors About Themselves list. I can't wait to see Celine's next project!",9.0
Past Lives,CinemaSerf,"""Na Young"" (Moon Seung-ah) and her best pal ""Hae Sung"" (Leem Seung-min) are pretty much joined at the hip at school. They do everything together. That is, until her family decide that they are going to emigrate to Canada. The young lad is a bit bereft, he doesn't really understand and he certainly doesn't approve! Anyway, off they go and after quite an hiatus, she discovers that he had tried to get in touch previously and so she now gets in contact. Now called ""Nora"" (and played by Greta Lee), she has married ""Arthur"" (John Magaro) and moved to NYC, but as they continue to chat online they gradually rebuild their friendship so that a visit from Korea to the USA seems the natural next step. What now ensues are a poignantly constructed series of reminiscences that extol the virtues and innocence of their childhoods but also illustrate how different they have become - even while the underlying bedrock of her relationship with him (and, for that matter with her husband) is probably just as solid - though not in quite the same way. There's a bit of pining, a bit of regret - but the film also fairly optimistically looks at where their lives have got to, and also of where their lives have yet to go. The acting isn't really much to write home about, though Magaro delivers well as the gooseberry. He doesn't speak much Korean and so the chats with their visitor frequently leave him in a sort of nervous, but polite, limbo. There are a few films around just now that focus on reconciliation of those separated by migration when South East Asia was still recovering from post war/French colonial rule - and this one is certainly one of the more interesting and honest. It's not without the odd bit of humour either - and is well worth a gander.",7.0
Past Lives,BornKnight,"An american A24 very adult romance and drama movie that gets in you little by little, slow burning with a gentle flame and involves more than just love, but personal choices and fate too.

Jump 12 years later accidentally she discovers that he was looking for her, and they start to chat online together, and the old fire starts to ignite again... till the day she says with a broken heart that because neither of them can see each other too soon and because she need to focus on her work they should to stop talking for a while.

Will mankind pull together to promote the uncertain continuation of the species, or is it a case of every man for himself? In this South Korean disaster film about what happens when a massive (and unexplained, not to mention highly improbable) earthquake destroys all of Seoul (and beyond apparently), except for one high-rise apartment building whose residents must decide whether to save only themselves or attempt to help displaced outsiders, despite a crucial lack of resources. What follows is essentially an apocalyptic retelling of The Lord of the Flies, with occasional back story flashes in the vein of television’s Lost. However, the film’s modestly engaging psychological thriller aspects aside, much of the narrative consists of a string of predictable (and not especially original) episodic incidents, most of which consist of various factions battling one another to become the prevailing alpha dogs. It’s not something we haven’t already seen many times before. What’s more, there’s precious little in the script to make viewers want to care about these people, primarily because of its tepid character development and an overreliance on recurring conflict (yawn). Add to that obvious and heavy-handed stabs at metaphorical geopolitical symbolism, erratic shifts in overall tone (particularly in the film’s first half), and a handful of feeble attempts at comic relief, and you’ve got a picture in need of serious retooling. It’s indeed puzzling to see the many accolades that have been so generously lavished on writer-director Tae-hwa Eom’s third feature outing in light of the project’s pervasive failings. But, beyond its imposing special effects and an impressive production design, there’s not much here to write home about. Wait for this one to come to home media if you’re really interested in sitting through this overlong slog.",5.0
Luca,garethmb,"The artists at Disney and Pixar have returned with a new animated film “Luca” which will debut on Disney+ on June 18th.

The film introduces audiences to Luca (Jacob Tremblay); a young Sea Monster who lives with his family and fellow fish off the coast of a small town in Italy. Luca is warned not to go on the surface and to avoid humans at all costs by his parents.

When a rebellious Sea Monster named Alberto (Jack Dylan Grazer); happens upon Luca and gets him to the surface; Luca discovers that he and Alberto appear as human boys when their skin is no longer wet.

Fascinated by the rebellious life Alberto leads and amazed by what he sees upon his brief land excursions; Luca looks for new ways to find time on the surface which leads to him being more and more deceptive to his parents.

In time Luca and Alberto head to the village and meet a spunky local girl named Giulia (Emma Berman); who is on a break from school and longs to win a local race in order to get back at the reigning champion and bully.

Luca and Alberto see the race as a chance to win money to buy their own Vespa which they see as the key to exploring the surface world which sets a chain of events into motion as their two worlds are about to collide leading up to the race.

The film is visually appealing, but the story for me dragged and did not have the spark and heart that have made countless PIXAR films enduring classics. While the characters were fine; they did not have the appeal or charisma that I have come to expect with the PIXAR brand.

There have been reports that after “SOUL” was moved from a theatrical release to streaming during the Pandemic that some at PIXAR were upset with the decision to make “Luca” a streaming option.  My take is that it was 100% the correct decision as while it is an entertaining film; it is not one that is likely to light up the Box Office and is better suited for a streaming debut.

The biggest issue with “Luca” is that coming from a studio with such a long line of classics; it fails to reach the levels previously set and while entertaining comes up lacking.

Luca,Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/luca-spoiler-free-review

""Luca follows the studio's formulas of success closely without taking any unique detours, but it still tells a compelling story with relatable characters that gets to the viewers' heartstrings. From the detailed animation that makes the Italian coast look realistically astonishing to Dan Romer's rich score that hits all the right notes, without forgetting the outstanding voice work, every Pixar's trademark technical attribute is present in an admittedly less complex, unsurprising narrative. Enrico Casarosa takes Jesse Andrews and Mike Jones' light screenplay through a generic structure, where the ""feeling/being different"" theme is efficiently developed but closed in an underwhelming manner. Nevertheless, predictability means nothing in a movie where fully-developed characters spend the summer creating genuine friendships with an impactful emotional weight that might induce a couple of tears in the last few powerful minutes. It's not my favorite Pixar flick, but it's definitely a good film that I wholeheartedly recommend watching.""

Rating: B",7.0
Luca,Kamurai,"Really good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

This is full of fun and child-like wonder, with a surprising edge to it as there is an usual amount of violence directly related to the main characters.

This has a very wholesome feel to it as it has the romantic aspect of searching for new frontiers and adventures, but not necessarily for romantic relationships.

The story does a good job of pacing out the events of the movie allowing for each aspect to take the focus it needs.

While this is a movie about a triatholon, it's a better story about freedom and acceptance.",7.0

Luca,CinemaSerf,"This is quite a fun tale that sees the eponymous young lad make friends with a sea creature ""Alberto"" who is disguised as a boy. Life on the Italian Riviera is pretty much all it's cracked up to be for these friends. They do the odd bit of fishing but for the most part it's pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner interspersed with loads of gelato and fun on the moped. What ""Luca"" isn't quite prepared for, though, is discovering the true identity of his new friend - nor is he without his own secrets to keep, either! Unsurprisingly, that puts a bit of a strain on things - testing their friendship, loyalty and, ultimately, their priorities. Now of course there's no jeopardy here, but the characterisations are quirkily constructed and there's just a soupçon of teenage romance (with ""Giulia"") as these two boys become inseparable and build what we hope is a relationship robust enough to survive whatever society throws at them. There are some entertaining supporting roles - the one-armed fisherman uncle and his parents add a richness to the story that is, admittedly, a bit slow off the mark - but it is still one of this studio's more enjoyable family experiences with a message of perseverance and acceptability that is delivered, not laboured. Derivative? Well, yes - it does remind you of quite a few other maritime magical stories, but it's still got enough originality to make it worth a watch.",7.0
Ferrari,Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/ferrari-venice-film-festival-review-penelope-cruz-drives-an-uneven-biopic/

""Ferrari has the potential to be a memorable biopic but lacks a more thoughtful emotional focus in its performance-driven character study. Adam Driver is excellent, but Penélope Cruz clearly stands out with an emotionally devastating performance.

The dialogues between the main couple are the highlights of a globally abrupt film that deals with the deaths of people outside the family nucleus in a manner that is too fleeting and insignificant, in addition to overdramatizing a particular subplot.

Competent racing sequences. It fulfills the basic purpose of telling the story of a complex man whose life is much sadder than one can imagine.""

Rating: B-",6.0
Ferrari,CinemaSerf,"Perhaps Adam Driver thought his ""House of Gucci"" (2021) role would better qualify him to play the eponymous and visionary Italian motor sport impresario, but what we really end up with here is more in the vein of the recent Bradley Cooper ""Maestro"". Sure, there are some great re-enactments of the races - though maybe not at the beginning with Driver's faced superimposed into a car like you'd put a kid's face on a birthday card. The bulk of the rest of this is more a treatment of his tempestuous marriage with Laura (an uncharacteristically flat Penélope Cruz) and how he juggles his family - and their past tragedies - with his second family with Lina (Shailene Woodley) and son Piero (Giuseppe Festinese) about whom his wife knows nothing! The business is struggling. The production car manufacture is no longer paying for the racing cars and with bankruptcy looming, Enzo must put all of his eggs into the one basket that is the thousand mile endurance Mille Miglia and hope to win and generate extra sales. It's this last half hour that brings the film to life. You can almost smell the fumes of the engines as the cars race the narrow and treacherous roads of rural, post war, Italy. There's also an indication of the honour amongst the drivers and an awareness of the respect that they have for each other - especially as we know fatality and disaster are frequently in that cockpit too. At it's best, it's an intense and well photographed almost documentary style of film, but there's too much pointless, meandering, melodrama with a leading man who just hasn't a charismatic bone in his body. Although I didn't hate it, it was way too much about a flawed marriage and not about the engineering that made me care.",6.0

""The Holdovers left me in complete disbelief at how complete, thought-provoking, hilarious, and emotionally powerful it becomes with each extraordinarily captivating minute that passes by.

A shockingly faultless screenplay from David Hemingson exponentially attacks the viewers' hearts through a truly profound yet bittersweet study of the vital need for human connection. Protagonists are brilliantly written as real people, and superbly portrayed by an award-worthy cast.

Add an immaculate tonal balance and outstanding execution by Alexander Payne, and a new Christmas classic is born.""

The Holdovers,Brent Marchant,"Heartwarming films for the holidays are something we’re all supposed to love, right? Well, if you’re talking about the works of directors like Frank Capra, George Seaton, Michael Curtiz and Chris Columbus, you’d be correct. But, since it’s been so long since we’ve had releases of that quality, in recent years, viewers hungry for such movies have been glomming on to anything that even remotely approaches such titles, whether or not the accolades are deserved. And that, in my view, sums up my feelings on the much-celebrated new feature from director Alexander Payne. This tale of a curmudgeonly, condescending, middle-aged, fuss-budget prep school teacher (Paul Giamatti) assigned to babysit a group of rambunctious students who are unable to be with their families for the year-end holidays has a premise with considerable potential that, unfortunately, is squandered by a narrative that feels loosely stitched together and ultimately comes across as patently undercooked. Indeed, what could have been a fun-filled romp a la a Christmastime take on movies like “Dead Poets Society” (1989), regrettably, comes up decidedly short. Admittedly, the film has its share of modestly funny and warm, fuzzy moments, but many of the scenes don’t flow smoothly from one to the next, creating a storyline that feels forced without delivering the goods to make a release like this work. While it’s true that the film succeeds (surprisingly) at depicting the mostly one-dimensional characters’ requisite personal evolution over the course of the picture, that almost-accidental accomplishment is seriously overshadowed by a series of plot elements that largely feel thrown together, incorporated without a terribly great amount of thought and an undeniable lack of cohesiveness. And, to be honest, the picture’s most interesting character is the academy’s chief cook (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), whose richly layered persona (and deftly nuanced performance) runs circles around those of its other two principals (Giamatti and Dominic Sessa as one of the stranded students). It’s disappointing that a director as talented as Alexander Payne has churned out a project as half-baked as this one is (particularly one that comes across as self-satisfied with itself as this offering often does) when compared to previous titles like “Nebraska” (2013) and “The Descendants” (2011). And would-be viewers should be wary of many of the inflated claims and awards season buzz being showered on this offering. But, in an age in which moviegoers are looking for pictures that provide the kind of holiday cinema comfort they so desperately crave, it’s understandable that such viewers might be drawn to a film like this.

My Score : 92/100

""The Holdovers"" is heartwarming tale of unlikely friendships. It's the kind of movie that lingers with you, gently nudging your conscience and leaving your heart a little fuller than before. The storyline is relatively straightforward, yet it's beautifully executed in a way that breathes a palpable life into each character and every scene.The film's setting, the 1970s, is captured with a sense of brilliance and authenticity that transport you back in time. The arcs of sensibility and chemistry between the characters grow on you as you watch their journey unfold. The film's runtime of 133 minutes feels like a swift, captivating journey rather than a drawn-out narrative. The powerful performances by the central leads, storytelling that feels personal, and the charming chemistry between the characters make this a wonderful Christmas film.


1. Heartwarming 1970s film: The film's setting, the 1970s, is captured with a sense of brilliance , subtlety and authenticity that transport you back in time. The film doesn't claim to be a comedy, but the subtle humour injected into the narrative adds a layer of charm and depth.

2. Compelling characters: The plot revolves around a cranky history teacher (Paul Giamatti), a troubled student, and a grieving cook. What starts as a friction-filled teacher-student relationship gradually evolves into an endearing friendship. The arcs of sensibility and chemistry between the characters grow on you as you watch their journey unfold. 

3. Thoughtful Narrative : Holdovers is an heartwarming tale of unlikely friendship which carefully takes its characters and give them their own arcs. Its so sensible yet cheerful that you fall for the characters instantly as you spend some time with them.

4. Swift and engaging:  The film's runtime of 133 minutes feels like a swift, captivating journey rather than a drawn-out narrative. Feels like a smooth buttery screenplay transporting you in the 1970s and you dont need to exercise your brains and enjoy a film.

5. Oscar-worthy performances: Paul Giamatti, in his portrayal of Paul Hunham, delivers a performance that is nothing short of magnetic. His brilliant acting justifies why he is often termed ingenious. He brings a depth to his character that feels authentic and relatable, making it easy for the audience to root for him. Dominic Tessa, as Angus Tully, encapsulates his character's loneliness, frustration, and excitement with a performance that is exceptional. He is a bright star in the making.

The Holdovers,CinemaSerf,"Anyone remember John Houseman's professor ""Kingsfield"" in ""The Paper Chase"" (1973)? Well, that's who Paul Giamatti reminded me of here with his portrayal of the acerbic, no-nonsense, ancient civilisations lecturer ""Hunham"". It's the last day of term and he hands out examination results that persist at the lower end of the A-F scale! This causes quite a bit of consternation amongst the silver-spooned students who fear their wealthy parents more than him. He agrees to try and mitigate these impending disasters by giving them extra work but that just irritates the B+ student ""Tully"" (Dominic Sessa) whose intervention doesn't exactly make him any friends! Anyway, serendipity takes her revenge now and this lad's planned Christmas in St. Kitts is kiboshed and he finds himself stuck at school over the holidays with his least favourite school colleague ""Kountze"" (Brady Hepner) and his teaching nemesis all sleeping in the infirmary! Drawbridges are up and battle lines drawn right from the outset, and are only exacerbated when the other kids are whisked off skiing leaving just the two and their long-suffering cook ""Mary"" (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) - a lady who also happens to be grieving for her son who has been killed in action before his twentieth birthday. Not the makings for much festivities, but gradually the three begin to bond a little, the ice begins to thaw and - well I suppose the rest isn't really too hard to guess. It's not really the story that makes this work - that's not especially unique. It's the three characterful performances - especially from the young Sessa - peppered with a wonderful selection of perfectly delivered sarcastic humour, temper tantrums, a little slapstick and an increasingly engaging rapport between the two men who must learn to overcome their differences - some serious, some trivial, some completely non-existent - so that maybe, just maybe, they will be able to resume after the New Year on less openly hostile terms. To that end, our trio take a trip to Boston - but will that help? It does rather run out of steam towards the predicable ending but the first forty minutes are genuinely laugh out loud at times. Giamatti and Randolph are naturals with Sessa looking like a man we will see again.

Its a subjective point but I found this one too brutal and shocking, for me to really say I found it compelling. I think too, a more subtle approach could have been taken, with better results in terms of watch-ability.

Of course what he really wants is to reunite with ""Tessa"" but can he grow up enough to realise the errors of his ways and to reconcile with her? Well I really could not have cared less. Initially I found Tiffin to have a little charm about him, but now this part has been well and truly exhausted and he has neither that charm nor any charisma to bring to a role that really consists of a pretty odious and self-indulgent character. There's lots of familial discord, an on/off drink problem (probably for us watching, too) and the ending was more like a sigh of relief for all concerned. I know, I'm not the demographic - but money has been spent on this - and it's money that could have been better spent on - well, just about anything.

their other recent hit “Five Nights at Freddy’s”.

The movie stars Wyatt Russell and Kerry Condon as Ray and Eve Walter; a married couple trying to raise their two children and deal with Ray’s M.S.
diagnosis. Ray is a former Major League Baseball player and holds out hope that he can overcome his situation and make a return to his profession even if those around him do not.

A life on the road has caused Ray to miss many events such as the birth of their daughter as well as be distant from their son. A new job at a prestigious school offers Eve a chance to have the needed insurance for Ray and work to do while she completes her degree.

The family opt to purchase a home with a pool versus renting as the ability to finally have some stability and use the pool for therapy is a welcome combination. This is enhanced by the discovery that the pool is
actually filled by a natural water source which Ray believes is healing him and rapidly putting him on the road to recovery.

Things are not as they seem as the pool holds some dark and deadly secrets that go back for decades and the family soon finds themselves dealing
with forces beyond their control as they desperately try to survive.

The film has an interesting premise though at times I did think about various other films and some of the shock moments failed to get me as they did others in the audience but I am not one who startles easily.

The cast was strong but at times I found myself not caring as much for the outcomes of certain characters as I was more concerned with the overall
explanation behind the supernatural elements of the film.

Despite this, it was an enjoyable watch that provided something a bit different than the usual monster or psycho on the loose horror film and Co-Writer/ Director Bryce McGuire has adapted his short film well into a
film which provides just enough of what the core audience wants to make it an effective horror entry.

""Night Swim fails to rise above the limitations of its generic horror foundation.

Despite commendable performances from Wyatt Russell, Kerry Condon, and the emerging Amélie Hoeferle, Bryce McGuire's reliance on exhausted tropes, predictable jumpscares - even if well-executed - and underdeveloped themes and characters ultimately sink the movie under the weight of its own uninspired narrative choices, namely the rushed ending with frustrating messaging.

Fight Club,Manuel São Bento,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @
https://www.msbreviews.com

David Fincher’s new film, Mank, is coming soon on Netflix, released six years after his latest installment, Gone Girl. Therefore, this week I’m reviewing five of Fincher’s movies. Se7en was the first one, and now it’s time for one of the most culturally impactful films of the 90s, Fight Club. This is another rewatch of another filmmaking classic, one that I was never able to absolutely adore like most people. When this movie came out in 1999, critics were extremely divided, and the film failed at the box office. With time, it gained a cult following through home media, but it’s still considered a very controversial piece of cinema. So, nothing new, having in mind Fincher is at the helm.

Despite this being my third or fourth time experiencing this story, I never really changed my opinion about it, which is a bit uncommon in my viewing history. Usually, after multiple rewatches, my overall thoughts about a movie slightly vary, but Fight Club is one of the few exceptions. I believe my opinion remains intact from the very first watch. I really enjoy this film, but I can’t state that I absolutely love it. Since this is a special case, I’m going to start with what still bothers me after so many viewings, something I also rarely do in my reviews since I always leave the bad stuff to the end of the article.

Without spoiling anything, of course, there’s a vital plot twist that comes later in the movie that I could only appreciate by its execution, but never by its impact on the narrative. Jim Uhls’ screenplay relies on the main characters’ friendship to carry the story forward, and throughout the first two acts, Fincher leaves not-that-subtle hints to a massive revelation, which eventually triggers the beginning of the third act. This major plot point is brilliantly executed, and I still feel incredibly fascinated by its delivery, both in terms of the dialogue and the performances. However, its impact on any lightly focused, observant viewer is close to zero due to the clear evidence that pointed towards this development.

Now, I don’t want to sound like that stereotypical moviegoer that says, “I guessed the twist before its revelation, hence it all sucks”. Like I insinuate above, I was still wholly captivated during the entirety of the third act. Nevertheless, Fight Club’s runtime is far from being short, and Fincher spends a lot of time building up an idea that loses its surprise factor even before the film’s midpoint. It changes the protagonist’s perspective, it takes the viewer through a predictable yet entertaining path, setting up a powerful, meaningful ending. However, personally, I don’t feel like the time spent in the first two acts was satisfyingly compensated in the end… at least, not in its entirety.

The second act also has a short period where it loses a bit of steam due to some repetitive sequences and an unnecessary amount of flashbacks. Again, I feel like Fincher didn’t completely trust the audience back then, contrary to his procedure in Se7en. In the latter flick, Fincher left the biggest responsibility to the viewer’s imagination, leaving the murder scenes for the audience to picture in their minds. In Fight Club, that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present, sure, but even before the third act, there’s already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that I wish would stay vaguer.

Like I insinuate above, I was still wholly captivated during the entirety of the third act. Nevertheless, Fight Club’s runtime is far from being short, and Fincher spends a lot of time building up an idea that loses its surprise factor even before the film’s midpoint. It changes the protagonist’s perspective, it takes the viewer through a predictable yet entertaining path, setting up a powerful, meaningful ending. However, personally, I don’t feel like the time spent in the first two acts was satisfyingly compensated in the end… at least, not in its entirety.

The second act also has a short period where it loses a bit of steam due to some repetitive sequences and an unnecessary amount of flashbacks. Again, I feel like Fincher didn’t completely trust the audience back then, contrary to his procedure in Se7en. In the latter flick, Fincher left the biggest responsibility to the viewer’s imagination, leaving the murder scenes for the audience to picture in their minds. In Fight Club, that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present, sure, but even before the third act, there’s already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that I wish would stay vaguer.

Don’t worry, I’m done with the negatives, and don’t forget: I really, really like this movie. Obviously, Fincher and Uhls created a story packed with underlying themes and social commentary. From the whole consumerism theory to the more psychological component regarding Edward Norton’s mental state, every message is seamlessly communicated to the audience. I’ve also been through a point in my life where I wish I’d be someone else, someone who had already achieved every dream of mine successfully with an overwhelming feeling of fulfillment. Coping with the inability to become that perfect someone can become an excruciating, sad, depressing process, and it varies drastically from person to person.

Fight Club approaches mental health and people’s acceptance of who they truly are in a groundbreaking manner, capturing Edward Norton’s emotions perfectly and broadcasting his thoughts through some of the best narration in the history of cinema. Its take on the world of consumerism is undoubtedly interesting and plays a big part in the climax of the film. Despite the issues described above, Uhls’ screenplay is very well-written, elevating the conversations between Norton and Brad Pitt (Ad Astra, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), which are indeed remarkably entertaining. Predictable or not, the main story is wonderfully executed by Fincher, who continues to demonstrate his impressive technical attributes.

Once again, the pre-production phase is proved here to be as important as any other stage in the filmmaking process. Fincher’s dedication to his features is palpable and visible on-screen through every single technical aspect. This time, Fincher brought in Jeff Cronenweth as the director of photography, and both worked together to not only create that desaturated, realistic atmosphere that Fincher loves so much but also to deliver the brutal, violent, bloody fight scenes that keep the entertainment levels at their highest. With clean, consistent, coherent editing from James Haygood, the movie flows beautifully despite its lengthy runtime. The Dust Brothers’ score is quite alternative, which suits the also unconventional storytelling.

Last but not least, Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. I know it’s incredibly cliche to write that two actors share impeccable chemistry, but Norton and Pitt take it to a whole other level. In two physically-demanding displays, both actors deliver award-worthy performances that marked their careers. Pitt offers one of his most underrated portrayals, being extremely funny throughout the entire film, but also astonishingly badass, carrying his fight sequences as amazing as he does with his dialogues. On the other hand, seeing Norton go all-out is a terrific experience. I lack words to describe such an emotionally compelling interpretation, filled with powerful character moments. A final word of praise to Helena Bonham Carter (Enola Holmes), who also delivers an exceptional performance.

In the end, Fight Club is and will probably remain David Fincher’s most controversial movie for a long, long time. With an absolutely brilliant direction and execution, Fincher uses Jim Uhls’ captivating, layered, unconventional screenplay to tackle themes such as consumerism, society’s behavior, and mental health, seamlessly transmitting meaningful yet contentious messages. Once again, the filmmaking in display is technically flawless, going from the trademark authentic cinematography and production design to the unique score, all flowing superbly through excellent editing. Unfortunately, I don’t belong to the group of people who utterly love this film. The excessive (sometimes unnecessary) use of flashbacks doesn’t help, but it’s the enormous build-up packed with overly explicit clues to a significant (yet unsurprising) plot twist that ends up partially ruining the viewing for me. I also wish that the script developed a few plot points more ambiguously, but Brad Pitt and Edward Norton elevate the whole movie so much with their ridiculously outstanding performances that these small issues don’t keep me away from highly recommending one of the most memorable, iconic films of all-time.

Fight Club,r96sk,"I didn't enjoy this, pretty much at all, but still kinda appreciate how it all comes together. It's a weird one for me.

Overall, <em>'Fight Club'</em> underwhelmed me. I actually knew very little before viewing it, despite hearing about it on a surface level for years and years; well, one 'regulatory' part of it anyway. It's much deeper than I had expected. Unfortunately, I didn't find entertainment with any of it - it was, to be honest, a slog to sit through.

The only scene I can remember enjoying is the very last one, and I don't mean that negatively because the end shot is terrific. It's just everything that comes before didn't do anything for me. Yet, I still rate its intentions. It did keep me guessing amidst my, near, boredom and the 'event' is a good one on paper. It just failed to connect on me in actuality.

Brad Pitt is good as Tyler, though the likes of Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter give meh performances in my opinion. Meat Loaf is interesting, I guess, as Bob.

I'm evidently in the extreme minority with my thoughts, each to their own, but I honestly didn't get into it sadly. As noted, though, I still partially rate it weirdly. 6* feels harsh, so I give it 7*.",7.0
Fight Club,rsanek,"I was mostly neutral on this movie until the last third, when things turned psychologically thrilling and gave me American Psycho vibes.

Fight Club,Wuchak,"_**Finding enlightenment thru beating each other to a pulp**_

A 30 year-old man in Los Angeles works the office drudgery, but suffers insomnia (Edward Norton). He’s finally inspired by an unconventional woman he meets at support groups (Helena Bonham Carter) and, especially, a devil-may-care guy who lives on the outskirts of town (Brad Pitt). They start an underground club where men get together and vent their frustrations by beating the crap out of each other.

""Fight Club"" (1999) has a huge reputation as a stylish cult flick and is often ranked with the greatest films ever made. The first half is entertaining enough, both quirky and amusing; and I like the interesting themes explored: Escaping the maternal and material, being a slave to advertising, rebelling against life-stifling conformity, being a blind follower of a charismatic leader, finding your inner wild-man, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Cool, the nature of lawless “revolutionaries” (which is too reminiscent of ANTIFA thugs), the struggle with homosexuality interpretation, etc. 

That’s all highly commendable. Unfortunately, the second half isn’t compelling. I sat there bored and couldn’t wait for it to end. “Donnie Darko” (2001) had the same problem – promising set-up with clever ideas, but a tedious wrap-up. Meanwhile the twist that everyone gushes over is actually underwhelming and not very surprising, although it’s relatively interesting. 

Moreover, watching guys get radically beat up is only entertaining a couple times; after that it gets redundant. Speaking of which, how exactly does bare-knuckled fighting inspire or enlighten? Does it really help one’s life to have missing teeth, black eyes and other assorted injuries? Of course the movie doesn’t emphasize the long-lasting negative effects of regular brawling. Have you ever met a brawler, boxer or professional football player in his 50s with the perpetual aches & pains?

Cult flicks like “Pulp Fiction” (1994) deserve the praise and stand the test of time; this one disappoints mainly due to the curiously dull second half. But it's genius on the metaphorical level no doubt.

The film is overlong at 2 hours, 19 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles.

Fight Club,chosengreatone,"This is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time, stylistically, narratively, aesthetically, and creatively.

It uses very unorthodox camera angles, cute and effects to fully encapsulate this nihilistic, alternative culture that took over the late 90s and early 2000s.

It has very deep views on early corporate capitalism which really arose in the 90s, and it pulls no punches to deliver its beliefs on it. It’s very persuasive in its message about corporatism as it appeals directly to men’s natural instinct and rawness. It’s a very raw movie overall.

My only wish is that it could be longer. This movie SHOULD be 3 hours. But even then, it masterfully delivers an experience and segues beautifully into every scene, fulfilling every plot device and answering every question. There are no unleft answers with this movie, this movie is completely calculated and cold-hearted; much likes it main protagonist, Tyler Durden.

All of Us Strangers,Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/all-of-us-strangers-bfi-london-film-festival-review/

""All of Us Strangers is, without a doubt, overwhelmingly emotional and brutally devastating. Andrew Haigh explores childhood trauma and the protagonist's complex grieving process through countless memorably powerful, thought-provoking dialogues, performed brilliantly by the entire cast, especially Andrew Scott.

The background music by Emilie Levienaise-Farrouch creates an ideal melancholic atmosphere for the heavy, heartbreaking narrative, but the songs chosen for the final phase of the film will induce thousands of tears worldwide.

It occasionally loses its thematic focus, and it's unlikely to be watched again anytime soon, but it's even more improbable to be forgotten.""

Rating: B+",8.0
All of Us Strangers,Brent Marchant,"In a movie awards season that has had more misses than hits, it’s gratifying to see one that not only lives up to, but exceeds, its potential. Such is the case with writer-director Andrew Haigh’s latest offering, a heartwarming and heartbreaking story of love, reflection and healing all rolled into one. To say too much about the film would invariably lead to a plethora of spoilers, but suffice it to say that it tells a genuinely moving and touching tale of a 30-something gay Londoner (Andrew Scott) and his budding relationship with a mysterious new beau (Paul Mescal), an involvement very much influenced by the protagonist’s relationship with his own past, most notably his involvement with his parents (Jamie Bell, Claire Foy). This is one of those pictures that’s just about perfect in virtually every regard thanks to its stringent adherence to authenticity in the writing and the portrayals of its positively stellar cast, especially the highly underrated performance by Foy, whose role has puzzlingly been flying under the radar thus far. It’s also a production that will likely surprise viewers in myriad ways, defying expectations and telling a story that’s anything but apparent from what’s in its promotional trailer. Moreover, I’m impressed by the fact that this is an offering featuring gay characters in which their sexuality is not the principal focus of the narrative, something that truly distinguishes this feature from so many others in this genre. Add to these attributes a sensitively chosen soundtrack and some surprisingly innovative cinematography, and you’ve got one helluva fine movie. To be sure, this is one of those releases that, if it doesn’t touch you profoundly, you’d better check to see if you have ice water coursing through your veins. “All of Us Strangers” richly deserves whatever accolades it receives. It’s one of the year’s best, bar none.",9.0
All of Us Strangers,CinemaSerf,"""Adam"" (Andrew Scott) lives a rather lonely life atop a London tower block where he is struggling to write a new book. He's obviously had some success before, but right now he spends much of his time in front of the television watching video-taped editions of the BBC's ""Top of the Pops"" music programme. A fire alarms sends him onto the street where he espies the only other person living in their brand new building - who didn't bother to evacuate. Back upstairs that man knocks on his door, introduces himself as ""Harry"" (Paul Mescal) and suggests a night cap - with benefits! ""Adam"" declines and next day takes a train, goes for a walk and appears to pick up a man in a park. He follows him, they rendezvous outside an off-licence and we discover that this is actually his dad (Jamie Bell) who takes him home to his mum (Claire Foy) where they share a drink and a fond reminisce. He goes home and again bumps into ""Harry"" and we begin to sense that there is a smouldering chemistry between these two men that is slow-burning, but potent. In the course of their chat - one of those first date, polite, conversations about getting to know each other when you really just want to get on with some ""furious jumping"" - we discover something rather startling about his parents and this news completely recalibrates the story as the two men gradually see their relationship evolve and we learn a great deal more about what has led ""Adam"" to his current life of introspection and isolation. On many levels this is about intimacy. Sure, between the two men, but also between him and - separately and together - his parents and himself as we all embark on quite a poignant journey of discovery that doesn't shy away from issues of sexual and personal identity, (largely benign) ignorance and of longing. Not just physical longing, but psychological longing too. At times it reminded me of Haigh's must less sophisticated ""The Weekend"" (2011) in that it puts together two men in a closely knit scenario where neither know the other, both are distinctly different in personality and the conversational dialogue is plausible and relevant. The denouement takes a bit of getting used to - it's left field but then it isn't - before all fits quite neatly if disturbingly at the end. I've always been a fan of the ballsy Jamie Bell - and he delivers engagingly and emotionally here as does an on-form Mescal who again shows his acting diversity as the deliverer of character parts with, here, the perfect foil to the under-stated performance from Scott whose persona is about as enigmatic as I have seen. It benefits from a second viewing, and is most definitely not the slushy boy meets boy romance you might expect. Good soundtrack too - Frankie's ""The Power of Love"" sounds superb with cinema sound...",7.0
Soul,Manuel São Bento,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @
https://www.msbreviews.com

Out of my Top15: Most Anticipated Movies of 2020, eight were removed from this year's schedule due to the current global pandemic, so I didn't have that many films for which I felt incredibly excited. I love pretty much everything that Pixar puts out, and at the start of 2020, I noticed that the studio was releasing not one but two original animated movies, something quite uncommon in their history (only happened in 2015 and 2017). Onward was yet another success, but everyone knew Soul was the studio's big gun. December release date means better chances to win an Oscar, and the highly anticipated return of Pete Docter (Monsters Inc., Up, Inside Out) to the director and writer's chairs also elevates the film's expectations.

I'm no different. My expectations were high as the sky, but the main question in my mind wasn't really if Soul was going to be a great movie, but if it would be so good I'd love it more than Wolfwalkers, my favorite animated flick of the year so far? Well, let me write that it's a wonderful, beautiful, heartwarming tie. I love them both very much, and I wouldn't be surprised if I saw them in my Top10. However, this is Soul's spotlight, so let me get to it, and spit out the only minor issue I have with the film. During the first act, I couldn't feel a connection to the story nor the characters. It took me a while to really get fully invested in the narrative, and even technical aspects such as the animation style and the score (Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross) felt weirdly out-of-place and surprisingly not that enthralling.

Nevertheless, this slow, unconvincing beginning doesn't negatively impact the movie overall, as most of these apparently awkward components improve as time goes by. From the moment it clicked with me, I went on that emotional rollercoaster I always expect to ride in a Pixar feature. The studio is known for its extremely heartfelt, shocking, tear-inducing third acts, and even though Soul isn't an exception to that rule, it's far from being one of those mind-blowing, jaw-dropping, devastating final minutes. Its third act is astonishingly emotional, and it sends a lovely message to the audience, one that made me reflect on the entire year and a specific moment in my life.

Pete Docter, Mike Jones, and Kemp Powers explore the taboo subject of life's meaning in a predictable yet profound and entertaining manner. The approach on philosophical questions like ""what's my purpose?"", ""what's my spark?"", or ""what does it mean to have a soul?"" is cleverly developed and very well-written. There's a sequence with the protagonist near the end that will make tons of viewers experience it simultaneously. I found myself rewatching this scene in particular to help me remember a certain period in my life where I realized that what I thought was my destiny was, in fact, just one of those life passions that leave us with unforgettable memories.

I was able to deal with that moment pretty well, but many people lose themselves once they figure out that what they thought they were meant to do/be isn't really what the future holds for them. They become lost souls, and only a spark of life can revitalize them. Soul explores this matter in such an authentic, genuine, creative way that I couldn't help but cry as I do in every Pixar film. Watching Soul will make you appreciate life a lot more, especially those tiny, little moments that we forget to remember. Living, with all its horrible phases, is the best life experience anyone can have. After a year of isolation and separation from the people we love, this movie arrives at the perfect time.

Technically, the animation style and score didn't convince me in the first few minutes, but by the end, they're part of the key aspects that made me cry like a baby. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are starting to become two of my favorite composers (The Social Network, Gone Girl, Mank). Pete Docter proves that his undeniable talent behind the screen remains intact, and this time, he introduces Hollywood to the debutants Kemp Powers and Mike Jones. Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey (22) deliver some terrific voice work, so expect them to receive dozens of nominations. Finally, congratulations to every single artist that worked on this film's animation. These gifted people are the real stars of Pixar.

All in all, Soul is everything I expected it to be. A classic Pixar feature, with the trademark emotionally powerful third act; a heartwarming, sweet, tear-inducing score; and a relatable, profound, well-explored story about our own soul and the meaning of life. Pete Docter delivers another award-worthy flick with the help of Kemp Powers and Mike Jones, and with the outstanding voices of Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey. It may start slow and follow a predictable path, but it's only a matter of time until every viewer connects with the main characters. Soul surpasses the barriers of cinema, becoming a healing media from which people can take away so, so much. It works seamlessly as a reflection on life, and as a motivation to truly live every single moment of it. It's the ideal movie to watch on the morning of Christmas Day with the entire family cozy and warm in the living room. I promise you: it will make you enjoy this festive season a lot more. Undoubtedly, one of the best films of the year.

Soul,rlaphoenix,"This is my favorite Disney Pixar movie, even beating Monster's Inc!

There wasn't a minute where I wasn't enjoying the movie, there's very powerful meaning to this movie (that will go over kids' heads) and for once, it (in my opinion) tackles an issue big with teens and adults more than kids (at least more than usually).

The movie's message is (from what I understood it anyway) about anxiety, sadness, and fear of how you choose your life path. Even going as far as showing how you're so-called purpose in life may not even be correct (or real to begin with).

This is by the creators of Inside Out, which gave really good messages across about feelings. It was more kid-oriented, so Soul (in my opinion) being more about teens or adults was a surprise that I did not expect. I'm not saying this isn't a kids movie, I'm saying you shouldn't avoid it if you're not a kid.

It probably helps this movie that it's got it's messages across with Music as an instrument (get it?), as I too love music heavily including all kinds of genres (seriously, if you saw my YouTube music history you would think I'm somewhere between a 5-year-old girl, to a 101-year-old Beatles fan).

I seriously recommend giving this one a watch.",10.0
Soul,SWITCH.,"In a year where most of us have been trapped indoors, the timing of 'Soul's' release can be seen as either a blessing or a curse. For some, it will act as a calming balm for a tough year; the perfect vehicle for inducing a good cry. Others, on the other hand, may reject it as yet another unnecessary mirror held up to their biggest fears exacerbated by a year where living with perceived “purpose“ has been near impossible. No matter which side of this you fall on, 'Soul' implores you to find beauty and gratitude in your circumstances. There is no doubt that is by far the best film Pixar has released in years - possibly even this decade.

Soul,Ricardo Oliveira,"Soul is the latest effort by Disney Pixar, a beautiful and wonderful film that will leave anyone to ponder about life, its value and the magic inherent in existence. 

The film tells the story of a man who accidentally falls into a ditch and ""dies"". However, he does not accept his death and begins a journey into his own afterlife until he is able to reunite with his body, in a coma on earth. 

For a children's film, Soul is surprisingly deep, perhaps even too deep, especially for a child. The film touches on various existential themes, from purpose to the meaning of life, and will make us lose ourselves in thoughts about our own life.

The characters are a marvel, especially the protagonists, because they are complete with complex layers that give us all kinds of feelings. The voices that bring them to life do an excellent job in making all the emotions that pass through them appear. 

When it comes to animation, once again Pixar exceeds itself and brings us a film that is a living work of art, each frame a beautiful picture of colours and movement that extends for two hours. It's really magical to see life on the small screen, the realism in some of the scenes will leave the audience really amazed. 

The smaller ones, however, may not understand the complexity of the film, and I don't feel that this is exactly the most entertaining film that will make them pay attention in 100% of the scenes, much due to the fact that it is not necessarily as energetic as many of the most watched animated films in recent years. It is, however, a valuable lesson that is present in the film, and letting children try to understand it will be the right choice to make when viewing Soul. 

All in all, this effort by Pixar is worthwhile, wonderful, beautiful and moving. The truth is, I found myself reevaluating my whole life and pondering the fact that time is money, because time is life.",
Soul,Kamurai,"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

I'll have to admit, I went into this thinking it would be Disney's yearly racist progressive attempt, so the bar was pretty low.

The movie is actually delightful, and shockingly deep.  The title indicates it has to do with the human soul, so I was expecting something along the lines of ""Inside"" or having to do with jazz, and while it has a rather nice combination of those two things, the attempt on the deep inner workings of the universe in the ""inbetween"" is incredible.

I imagine everyone will have their own interpretations of what the movie represents mechanically, but the story itself focuses on the pursuit of dreams and happiness combined with the experience of life.

The movie animation is fantastic and the voice actors are all top shelf.  The story is awesome, and the characters are strong, deep, and interesting.  I find it hard to believe that anyone would actually not like the movie.

The structure is a little basic for something so fantastical, but I think that's by design to keep appeal to most audiences that expect a general family Disney format.",7.0
Soul,r96sk,"Pleasant film.

<em>'Soul'</em> didn't connect with me on any deep level, but it is an undoubtedly sweet film. It attempts a lot of heart and I respect that. Jamie Foxx has been in some of my favourite films and he is good as Joe here. I also like the casting of Graham Norton as Moonwind.

One thing that probably stopped me thoroughly enjoying this is the animation and character design, particularly when in the ""Great Beyond"". It's not that it looks bad, or anything close, but I just found it a bit too plain. I never felt attached to any of the characters or settings there. I did, though, enjoy the sounds and music, especially in the aforementioned afterlife area. They do do that nicely.

She like shim, he likes her - then an accident befalls and in best ""Matter of Life and Death"" tradition, he is on a conveyor belt to the afterlife.

After a bit of bargaining, the latter, who has been there for aeons and has no interest at all in being ""born"" - agrees to help the former to get back to Earth in the right body. What ensues now are a series of characterful escapades that see them flirt with rebirth (only in swapped bodies) but that ultimately cause both to re-assess what their priorities are. Of course there's some moralising - it's Disney - but that is delivered quite subtly and wrapped in some entertainingly witty dialogue and some - though not enough - gorgeous jazz.

American Fiction,Brent Marchant,"It’s frustrating to watch a much-anticipated movie that doesn’t quite live up to expectations. Such is the case with writer-director Cord Jefferson’s debut feature. The problem here is that the film tries to tell two stories in one picture, one that it does brilliantly and one that could use some serious trimming, because the inclusion of its segments interrupts the flow every time it comes up during the course of the narrative. This tale of a talented but commercially unsuccessful African-American author (Jeffrey Wright) laments the success of a younger peer (Issa Rae) who writes a best-selling “Black” book that he sees as little more than market-pandering rubbish. However, in response, when he does the same under a pseudonym as a means of protest, he becomes an overnight sensation for all of the artistic and readership considerations that he personally despises. He now has to ask himself how can live with that kind of success, especially when the title becomes a runaway juggernaut. As he struggles with this, he’s also faced with a family drama with the death of a relative, managing the future of care for his Alzheimer’s-afflicted mother (Leslie Uggams) and a ne’er-do-well, self-centered sibling who’s reluctant to help out (Sterling K. Brown). Unfortunately, the domestic story thread is overlong and tends to bog down the satirical social commentary/personal integrity aspects of the picture, which are really strong enough to stand on their own and should have been given wider play (fault the screenplay here). Despite its shortcomings, however, “American Fiction” definitely deserves kudos for the performances of its ensemble cast, especially Wright, who turns in his best work here and has garnered a number of awards season nominations already, with more undoubtedly to come. In all, though, this feels like an offering that’s half-baked for what it serves up, which is regrettable, given that, with some shoring up in the writing, this easily could have become a modern screen classic.",6.0
American Fiction,CinemaSerf,"Jeffrey Wright is great in this satirical look at all things hypocritical and exploitative surrounding ""blackness"" in the USA. ""Monk"" is the short-tempered writer-cum-lecturer whose behaviour gets him put on indefinite leave by his university and sent to Boston! That's where his family live and where we get our first introduction to his sister ""Lisa"" (Tracee Ellis Ross). Now she's got the measure of her curmudgeonly brother and as they spar we start to see elements of his deeply-buried humanity emerge. Maybe he's not the man we first thought, and that depth of character becomes more evident as we meet his mother whose Alzheimers is causing confusion and distress. A tragedy strikes which forces ""Monk"" to re-address his own life choices, his relationship with his recently gay brother ""Cliff"" (Sterling K. Brown) and of his need to raise the almost $7,000 per month it will cost to ensure the best care for their ailing parent. His latest attempt at getting published failed. His agent ""Arthur"" (John Ortiz) telling him that his books just weren't black enough. He must be more like ""Sintara"" (Issa Rae) who writes books about 'real' African American people and their stereotypical ghetto language and experiences. He loathes the very essence of stuff like this, and so - in a fit of pique - cobbles together a novel called ""Pafology"" which he disdainfully sends off. To his bemused disgust, he is offered a lucrative seven figure sum - useful for the medical bills - and then, even more to his chagrin he meets film producer ""Wiley"" (Adam Brody) who wants to pay through the nose for the screen rights! Conflicted or what? He needs to look after his mother but his principles are abhorred by what he sees as a selling out. This scenario is only made the more ridiculous when he is asked to judge a prestigious literary award - and his now renamed best-seller is nominated! Cord Jefferson uses the brother's storyline as an engaging diversion - a broke plastic surgeon recently divorced and coming to his homosexuality late, but enthusiastically, in life. There's also his neighbour ""Coraline"" (Erika Alexander) to whom he takes a reciprocated shine - but can he make that work? It's genuinely laugh out loud at times as we see the frustrations of this man play out. It swipes at the superciliousness of an industry that is essentially not about culture or tradition: it's all about money and perception. The shallow things he despises. Will he come clean? Can he actually grow up a bit, too? Well that's skilfully dealt with in the gem of an ending!

""Priscilla navigates the familiar territory of biographical storytelling, offering a nuanced exploration of Priscilla Presley's life.

Cailee Spaeny's career-best performance skillfully delves into the complexities of a toxic relationship with Jacob Elordi's also convincing portrayal of Elvis. Sofia Coppola authentically captures Priscilla's struggles with love and fame, though it occasionally falls into a repetitive narrative.

Still, in the end, Spaeny's compelling portrayal elevates the film so much that I definitely recommend it for fans of the genre and/or subject matter.""

Rating: B-",6.0
Priscilla,r96sk,"Just rather uninteresting, on film terms at least.

It <em>is</em> interesting seeing the film portray a different type of version of Elvis Presley, one that is uncomfortable to watch unfold but one that ought to be told. That's where anything noteworthy I have to say about this release ends, though. As a movie, it's rather boring. I'm not convinced there's enough to be told across a full blown picture, at least not one around 1hr 45mins in length. I will say that Cailee Spaeny puts in a solid display as the titular character, in fairness.

Jacob Elordi as Elvis, in my opinion, isn't a positive to be honest. If I didn't know he was playing Elvis I genuinely wouldn't have guessed he was playing the singer, aside from a few outfits and the twisty bit of hair in his fringe. Accent particularly seemed off to me too, Elordi amusingly (given the director's connection) sounds more like Nicolas Cage (c. 1997, <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/con-air/"" rel=""nofollow"">Con Air</a>'</em>, Cameron Poe) on phone call scenes.

It's competently put together visually at least, though overall I can't honestly say this made a mark on me personally. I don't feel like I learnt anything about 'Priscilla' herself. I doubt I'll remember this one long term, sadly.",6.0
Priscilla,CinemaSerf,"Having recently watched Bradley Cooper's ""Maestro"" (2023) and ""Tchaikovsky's Wife"" (2022) I was wondering if Sofia Coppola was about to bowl us a bit of a googly about Elvis here after half an hour! The young Priscilla (a competent Cailee Spaeny) is invited to meet him (Jacob Elordi) in Germany where both he and her father are serving in the US military. Not yet 16, she is chaperoned to his home where it's quite clear they take a shine to each other. He returns home and after a while sends for her to come visit Graceland. She's totally besotted by this stage and what follows tells us the story of their burgeoning relationship. It's got to be said, that's not always plain sailing - he is hugely charismatic, but has a temper, is controlling, and is very career-minded. He's also not that interested in consummating their relationship, either! History tells us the rest and with the lady herself executive producing we're not going to stray very far from the facts - as she saw them - that gripped the tabloids and the world. It's curious that her parents would have allowed their pubescent daughter to go live with a millionaire rock star half a world away, and of course once she's there she is soon taking his uppers and downers like a trooper to stay the pace. At times, it's quite a potent look at just what both wanted from the relationship, and at how it becomes clear that it is impossible for both to reconcile their aspirations with their desired obligations to/of each other. It also shows us the increasing lack of a sense of self-worth or fulfilling continuity to her increasingly lonely existence. That's a well-made point in illustrating just how shell-like her day to day life was as she had access to unlimited funds but not to any palpable feelings of being needed or loved. Talking of pace, though, that's one of the things that I found really let this down. He is home, then he goes away, makes a film, has ""alleged"" affairs, comes home then does it all over again. Also, there is a real lack of his music here. Not that it's supposed to be about him, but it was an integral part of his allure and his personality - not to reflect that rendered his character rather charm-free and the rather bland Elordi hasn't really the skills to imbue his character with much, well, character on his own. I am afraid that I found this all just a bit shallow and though beautifully set, just too sterile a look at the turbulent life of those two people. It just lacks passion, power and substance.",6.0
Priscilla,Brent Marchant,"When a film seeks to depict the life story of a beloved public figure, it generally works best when it paints a comprehensive portrait of said individual. However, in this biography of the wife of rock ʼn roll icon Elvis Presley, viewers get a picture that seemingly tells only half of the story. Writer-director Sofia Coppola’s latest focuses on the years Priscilla Presley (Cailee Spaeny) spent with Elvis (Jacob Elordi). They embark on a sincerely loving relationship that, sadly, falls prey to problems with drugs, firearms, infidelity, prolonged separations and control freak tendencies, conditions – largely initiated by Elvis – that eventually lead to their separation (and at times cause the film to be more about him than her). Regrettably, the choice of this narrative leaves out the many significant personal and professional accomplishments of Priscilla’s life on her own, an inspiring story that’s completely (and perplexingly) overlooked. As a consequence, viewers are primarily shown a profile of a predominantly subservient character who rarely rebels until she finally somehow musters up the courage to leave (where did that trait come from?), with nothing about the successes that followed. In addition, there are many story threads that feel unresolved or underdeveloped, leaving audiences hanging about what comes from them. To its credit, “Priscilla” is, in several respects, some of the best (though surprisingly most conventional) work that Coppola has produced as a filmmaker, as evidenced in the cinematography and editing and in Elordi’s balanced portrayal of Elvis. But, like other of Coppola’s efforts, this offering could still use some tidying up in the writing, character development and overall story structure. The wife of a King truly warrants better treatment.",6.0
Memory,Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/memory-review-a-poignant-exploration-of-the-importance-of-memories/

""Memory is a poignant exploration of identity and relationships, anchored by mesmerizing performances from Jessica Chastain and Peter Sarsgaard.

Michel Franco delves into the profound significance of memories, tackling heavy themes such as dementia, sexual abuse, familial distrust, and trauma with authentic, non-exploitative care. The deliberately subtle technical choices, such as a colorless palette and the absence of a musical score, heighten the sensitive weight of the impactful atmosphere.

Packed with fascinating, morally complex characters, the movie stands as a testament to the transformative potential of cinema in studying the depths of the human experience.""

Rating: B+",8.0
Memory,Brent Marchant,"How we remember our past is something we can all bank on, right? Or is it? For instance, what happens when mitigating influences impact our memory, potentially causing it to become fallible and untrustworthy? Can we truly rely on our recall then? Those are among the questions raised in the unconventional new romantic thriller from writer-director Michel Franco. The film follows the life of Sylvia, a recovering alcoholic with a troubled past (Jessica Chastain), who’s unexpectedly (and alarmingly) followed home from her high school reunion by an alleged former classmate, Saul (Peter Sarsgaard), whom she believes sexually molested her at that time. She’s troubled by this latest development and questions his motives about it, which even he doesn’t understand, especially when it’s revealed that he suffers from dementia. And, in an added twist, it turns out that Sylvia’s recall about her supposed past interaction with him is foggy, something that’s not entirely surprising in light of her history. This revelation changes everything, and an entirely new relationship between them emerges, particularly when it comes to each of them helping one another sort of their respective pasts and begin the healing process. This includes the exposure of an array of additional developments and the persistence of some still-unresolved ambiguities, all of which emerge through a skillfully crafted narrative, effectively brought to life with the superb performances of Sarsgaard and Independent Spirit Award nominee Chastain. Admittedly, the picture’s first half could benefit from some stepped-up pacing, most notably the elimination of some sequences that are occasionally redundant and innately tiresome. However, the intrigue and engagement ramp up significantly in the picture’s back end, making up for much of the tedium in the opening act. Some of this is ironically accomplished through deftly handled nuance and subtlety, qualities that the filmmaker employs far more skillfully in the second half than in the first, where these traits are virtually obscured by prevailing understatement. Clearly, this is one of those releases that requires the viewer to give it some time to develop, but the payoff for doing so is worth it in the end. If nothing else, “Memory” provides us with a fresh perspective on its central theme while showing us how “like can cure like” in a psychological therapeutic process, an approach that can yield rewards beyond measure.",7.0
Memory,CinemaSerf,"Whilst the subject matter here is quite interesting, the execution isn't especially. ""Sylvia"" (Jessica Chastain) is working in the social care system whilst bringing up her daughter ""Anna"" (Brooke Taylor). Her life, as effectively illustrated by her door locking and burglar alarm routine each day, is a structured affair with little variation. She has a strong relationship with her sister but is completely estranged from her mother. The two women attend a school reunion one night and, leaving early, she is followed home. It's a miserable night and next morning she discovers him asleep outside her door. Inspecting his wallet, she discovers his identity and calls his brother ""Isaac"" (Josh Charles) who explains that ""Saul"" (Peter Sarsgaard) has memory issues. Was he stalking her or is there more to this rather meandering scenario? Chastain does work quite well, but I found the story seemed to randomly inject way too many ""incidents"" along the way that seemed designed to enliven or empower the plot. Many seemed a little too disaster-scenario prone and are used to enhance purely for dramatic purposes. The culminating scenes lacked plausibility and at times the whole thing came across as little better than an A-list soap opera. Coincidence underpins just a bit too much of the film and the delivery of information about the characters to the audience is all delivered in just too sporadically a fashion. I felt sorry for just about everyone involved, but I didn't feel particularly engaged.",6.0
May December,Lachlan Thiele,"<b>INT. MOCKING-MOORE - DAY </b>

May December is an excellent satire with incredibly dark themes at times. Portman's Elizabeth is an actress tasked with researching her next role, a movie based on the massively dramatised life of <i>Julianne Moore's</i> character. Moore and Portman shine in their roles, and both can create believable characters whilst still pushing the unbelievable humour and situations they are put in. Portman, mainly with her fascination with making an actual 'true-to-life' performance as <i>Gracie</i>, copies her quirks and tendencies, providing the audience with laughs. 
Primarily the humour lies in the dark aspects of the film. The funniest, without spoiling, Gracie's relationship with her husband. It continuously evolves over the film, and we finally reach a satisfying conclusion. It's interesting how the comedy-drama has the best character arcs out of all of the dramas that premiered at Cannes. 
Overall, <i>May December</i> lands on both feet, standing tall against the competition. Satirical, well-acted and entertaining.

May December,CinemaSerf,"This actually reminded me a little of ""All About Eve"" (1950) as television actress ""Elizabeth"" (Natalie Portman) arrives at the home of ""Gracie"" (Julianne Moore) about whom she is to star in a biopic. Initially welcoming of her and keen to help, we follow the changing dynamic as we learn that ""Gracie"" has quite a past, and that her husband of 20-odd years, ""Joe"" (Charles Melton) is considerably younger than her and there was quite a furore when they first hooked up that saw the older woman incarcerated. The more she finds out, the more involved ""Elizabeth"" becomes and the more immersed we all become in this quite compelling story of a taboo that rather broke a mould or two and is now surrounded by an atmosphere of hypocrisy, faux-friendships, and lemon drizzle cake. There is a strong, increasingly well delivered, competitiveness between these two women and Melton delivers quite strongly too as the young man who seems devoid of much purpose as he heads towards his forties. The script is quite tight, frequently potent and Todd Haynes's overall style of intimate direction genuinely encourages us to invest a little in one of the women - I didn't manage to invest in both, especially as the denouement loomed (perhaps just a little predictably). This film quite successfully presents us with quite an interesting character study that works both ways in their relationship - and is well worth a watch.",7.0
May December,Brent Marchant,"In moviemaking, there’s subtlety, and then there’s subtlety carried too far. In the case of director Todd Haynes’s latest, the filmmaker unfortunately indulges himself far too much in the latter. This story of an actress (Natalie Portman) who visits a middle-aged sex offender (Julianne Moore) to prepare for a role she’s about to play in a movie about her subject’s life never seems to find a footing to stick with and explore. The narrative examines many different aspects of the back story behind the lives of the characters to be portrayed in this pending production without ever really resolving any of them by the time the credits roll. This includes not only the protagonist’s reasons for pursuing her once-underage husband (Charles Melton) – actions that got her jailed and made her fodder for countless tawdry tabloid cover stories – but also the nature of the actress’s real motivations in conducting such an excessively intense in-depth study of her character. In the process, virtually everyone comes across as somewhat unsavory, and, considering that the truth is never clearly revealed about any of them, it begs the question, why should we care about any of this? The film depicts all of this so subtly that it goes beyond nuance, veering into the realm of enigmatic, thereby further reinforcing the notion of why any of us should care. Ironically, these underplayed elements are in stark contrast to some rather obvious (and terribly trite) symbolism, particularly in images related to themes of transition and transformation. The picture’s inconsistent changes in tone don’t help, either, vacillating between allegedly serious drama and a seemingly underdeveloped desire to break out as an exercise in full-fledged camp (which, by the way, probably would have made this a much better offering). The script’s meandering flow and glacial pacing also don’t help, leaving viewers scratching their heads more often than not as to where this story is headed. In the end, all of the foregoing is ultimately quite unfortunate, because there’s definite potential in this project, but it’s never adequately defined and fleshed out. Leads Moore and (especially) Portman turn in admirable efforts to make this material fly, but they simply don’t have enough to work with to make that happen. While there appear to be allusions to themes like the difficulty involved in dealing with long-buried feelings and the fact that we may never be able to adequately grasp the truth behind them (either as outsiders looking in or as active participants in the midst of such dealings), the cryptic handling of those ideas undermines whatever meaningful messages or cinematic value they might have, making all of this seem like just such a big waste of time. Director Haynes has an impressive filmography behind him with such releases as “Poison” (1991), “Far From Heaven” (2002) and “Dark Waters” (2019), but, regrettably, “May December” certainly can’t be counted as part of that list.",5.0
May December,r96sk,"Bit of a odd one. It gradually lost my attention a little the longer it went on, though overall it's a film I'd consider as interesting.

I know of the real life story that <em>'May December'</em> is ""loosely"" based upon, so it was intriguing early on to see how the film was going to tackle it. I think they did a good enough job with it all, the actress meeting the subject element makes the film more watchable than it otherwise would have been.

Natalie Portman, Julianne Moore and Charles Melton are a great trio onscreen, each giving a noteworthy performance. Portman impressed me most, though Melton really does come strong across the second part of the movie. The rest of the cast do well, particularly solid casting of the main two characters' children.

A very well made production, just one that did lose me slightly as it headed through its near 2hr run time - could've been shorter, imo. The main piano score, although excellent in itself, gets minorly annoyingly overused too. No hate though, I still enjoyed it and would recommend it.",7.0

""The Book of Clarence certifies Jeymes Samuel as a do-it-all in filmmaking.

Fortunate as well to have an absolutely superb cast with LaKeith Stanfield commanding the troops, delivering an impressively all-round performance. It lacks better tonal balance and more unpredictability, the latter being destroyed by an unnecessary opening sequence.

Monster is the latest entry in the Kore-eda filmography (a filmography I still need to dive deeper into). Still, just like his previous films, It's a deeply personal look into a character, their motives but most importantly, how that motive affects those around them.

Monster is a multi-layered beast; it retells one story from multiple perspectives giving us the whole cookie instead of just the crumbs. Usually, I'm a crumb kinda guy; I like to figure things out myself, putting them all together to get my cookie. Still, Kore-eda gives me the cookie; at points, he just hands the cookie over when instead I would have preferred the traditional 'show, don't tell' filmmaker mentality. Yet, without that one little critique Monster would have shot right up to a 4-star thanks to its standout performances from Sakura Ando as the mother and excellent direction (especially when it comes to blocking actors within a scene, yeah, I know a weird thing to point out but something I wrote down while watching)

Monster,Brent Marchant,"The perspective from which we view a situation infallibly provides us with a clear, irrefutable picture of its truthfulness, right? But what happens if we encounter someone who witnesses the same incident and comes away from it with a totally different interpretation? Both views can’t be “right,” can they? Or is it possible that none of us can see the totality of a scenario and claim to know everything about it? That’s the core takeaway from director Kore-eda Hirokazu’s latest feature, an ambitious, skillfully crafted tale told from multiple vantage points, all of them “correct” in their own right, despite the myriad differences that distinguish them from one another, a storytelling technique first developed by Japanese master filmmaker Akira Kurosawa in the screen classic “Rashomon” (1950). Kore-eda’s cinematic homage to the famed auteur, told in three separate but interconnected segments, focuses on the exploits of a rebellious pre-teen (Soya Kurokawa) seemingly prone to acting out as a bully. The youth’s unpredictable behavior, however, doesn’t tell the whole story. His actions appear to be cryptically interwoven with those of his overly protective widowed mother (Sakura Ando), his young middle school teacher (Eita Nagayama), his aging, softspoken principal (Yuko Tanaka), and his effervescent best friend (Hinata Hiiragi), many of whom aren’t always what they seem to be. There are forces at work here that are a cause for concern, prompting the often-asked question, “Who is the monster?”, a query that provides the inspiration for this film’s title. It’s intriguing to watch how the picture’s various story threads come together, reminding us of the old adage of not judging a book by its cover, poignantly illustrating that, no matter how much we may think we know about a particular situation, there’s a good chance we’ll never get a complete picture of it. Kore-eda serves up an eye-opening tale, one that gives us pause to think about our impressions and preconceptions in an age when many of us are all too quick to superficially judge what we see – and in a frequently flawed framework at that. The picture could stand to be a little more swiftly paced at times (especially in the final act), but this is arguably the director’s best and most sensitive work to date, one that, we can only hope, will have the kind of profound impact we need in an age where open-mindedness and tolerance are traits we could all stand to develop to a much greater degree – particularly when pieces of the puzzle are missing.",8.0
Monster,CinemaSerf,"I'm not usually a fan of children leading films, but hats have to come off here for a really delightful performance from the young Hinata Hiiragi as the shy and shunned ""Hoshikawa"". We will get to him in a minute, but first the film is delivered in three parts as a fire slowly devours a city centre tower block. The first episode introduces us to ""Minato"" (Soya Kurukawa). He's a bright and friendly boy who lives with his widowed mother (Sakura Ando). She starts to notice that his behaviour is a becoming a bit erratic and after some investigation begins to suspect that he is being bullied at school. A visit to the recently bereaved Principal (Yûko Tanaka) reveals that his teacher ""Hori"" (Eita Nagayama) might be the culprit and apologies are made. The next segment takes up the same story, only this time we look from the perspective of the teacher, a caring and enthusiastic professional. Though there are similarities between the two scenarios, the conclusion from the first doesn't quite tie up with the information from the second. Then to the final instalment where the two boys take and hold really well the centre stage of this drama and we get to grips with the puzzles set already and discover more about their complex characters. It's this third phase that is quite captivating to watch. The older boy must tread a thin line between a peer pressure that thinks his friend is odd, even that he has ""a pig's brain"" whilst he, himself, realises that ""Hoshikawa"" is a friendly, curious and loyal lad who has quite a few domestic demons of his own to face, on pretty much a daily basis. Amongst the adults, there's plenty going on too. The head teacher is clearly sitting on a fairly hefty secret of her own and ""Mr. Hori"" faces a series of predicaments that reminded me a little of the recent ""Teacher's Lounge"". A typhoon, some tunnels and an old railway carriage provide a perfect focus for the concussion that isn't so much that, it's an invitation to see what might happen next. The director excels here at putting us into the minds of the children and of the adults whilst also allowing our own observations to watch a story of two young children at a sensitive stage of their lives - and it really does make you think and reminisce about your own childhood in equal measure.

Tenet,SWITCH.,"I fully understand that Christopher Nolan is trying to play with time, as that what's the movie's about - and yes, he is known for confusing movies - but here, Nolan has made something uninteresting. The idea of things going backwards is cool, but the rules are unclear. We never know what the basic goal is - I could understand secrets, but the film has to be interesting and 'Tenet' simply isn't. Nothing here makes me want to work things out; it's forgettable. Sure, you can say this has to be seen on the big screen, but the long runtime makes it unappealing to most mainstream audiences. Unfortunately, 'Tenet' is not here to save the 2020 box office. I work at a cinema, and to say it underperformed well would be correct. We are going to see more 'Tenet' hot-take YouTube videos than thinkpiece/what you missed ones. Christopher Nolan has made his most forgettable film to date - it's not a bad movie and I'm sure his diehard fans will adore this one, but for everyone else, there isn't much here. 'Tenet' won't be remembered as another “groundbreaking visual spectacle“ from Nolan or for “saving cinema“. It will be remembered for its weird release schedule and having been shown during a global pandemic, and that's unfortunate. Like the rest of the year, 'Tenet' is a write-off.

Tenet,Manuel São Bento,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @
https://www.msbreviews.com

Christopher Nolan has delivered some of my favorite movies of the century. All the way from Memento to the most recent Dunkirk, I've yet to dislike one of his films, so expectations are always high with him. The current global pandemic closed movie theaters worldwide, but fortunately, some countries already opened them, including my own. My IMAX screening of Tenet was my first trip to a theater since February! As a firm believer and strong advocate of the so-called ""cinematic experience"", I would always remember fondly the day I returned to a place I hold very close to my heart independently of my opinion about the film. Nevertheless, it became an even more special day once I left that enormous screen behind with a happy face.

Nowadays, people complain about everything, especially on social media. So, I'm not surprised that the ""savior of cinema"" marketing tagline triggered so many souls. If Nolan didn't have enough haters, it surely got a few more after this campaign. Me? I look at it like any other marketing scheme: it's intended to hype its own movie, so I don't really understand why this specific publicity caused so much controversy. Obviously, ""savior of cinema"" doesn't mean Nolan is going to save theaters from dying. It's just a tagline trying to hype the first major blockbuster in several months! It's a marketing strategy to try and convince people to give Tenet a go. If there's a film meant to be seen at the biggest screen possible, this is the one.

I'll get the outstanding technical achievements out of the way. Inception and Interstellar boast impressive visuals that are hard to compete with, but Tenet is up to the challenge. With uniquely complex, stunning, grand set pieces, Nolan delivers riveting action based on a mind-blowing temporal concept that will make every single viewer scratch their heads. I lost count to the number of times I tried to open my eyes more so I could see (and understand) everything that was going on. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is handheld for a lot of action sequences, and he has such control over his craft that he was able to capture some of the most jaw-dropping action moments of the last few years through gorgeous angles and a firm grip.

Nolan said that Tenet would be ""the hardest movie to cut"" for any editor. Jennifer Lame's editing plays a vital role in the time inversion sequences. It's relatively easy to imagine how brutal of a task she must have had. She's incredibly consistent throughout the runtime with perfectly timed cuts that elevate even the simplest of scenes. I wish I could be more specific, but in order to avoid spoilers, I'll just write this: she has a bunch of nominations coming her way, including an Academy Award. Ludwig Göransson's score is tremendously powerful, and it definitely adds to the magnificent action set pieces, especially in the third act.

Finally, Nathan Crowley (production designer) creates such a realistic look that it almost made me believe this could actually occur in the real world. CGI has come a long way, and it's indisputably a tool that can completely transform films into something fascinating when used correctly. However, practical effects will always offer a feeling impossible to replicate through computerized images. It's probably the aspect I appreciate the most about this movie: its massive application of practical effects and real stunts. It surrounds the physics-defying premise within a bubble of realism, and that's only achieved with talented people in the right technical departments.

Story-wise... this is where it gets tricky. I have to be honest about my experience: I found it surprisingly okay to follow and not that challenging to understand. This doesn't mean that it isn't a remarkably complex, layered narrative with ideas that will be incredibly hard for some people to comprehend. I'm not trying to patronize anyone, far from that, but some viewers will inevitably leave the theater without completely understanding what they just saw, simply because it's a two-hour-and-a-half movie packed with heavy exposition about a fictional quantum physics concept. For example, in the same way that some people genuinely can't have a 3D perspective, other people will also have visual difficulties in distinguishing the inverted sequences.

The need to be vague about plot details doesn't let me explain a lot, but the unique concept Nolan develops in Tenet is undoubtedly an exceptionally intriguing idea. As crazy as it might sound, I found the visuals more confusing than the actual scientific explanations that they go with. Unfortunately, that's one of my main issues with the film. Throughout the entire runtime, there's an excessive load of exposition about the time shenanigans. It's a massive amount of information for anyone to be able to remember every single detail. Even worse, some dialogue sequences feel so incredibly forced that it's almost like the movie stops for quick breaks where the characters explain something directly to the audience.

This last point leads me to another problem. John David Washington gets better and better as time goes by, but he feels like a mediator between the film and the audience for the first half of the movie. His dialogue revolves around asking questions about what's happening and how the time inversion works, which is obviously understandable given the character's circumstances, but the execution of these conversations lacks that spontaneous vibe. It really feels like someone yelled ""Action!"", the actors did their lines, and that same someone yelled ""Cut!"". Washington isn't exactly a worldwide, well-known actor (Ballers, BlackKklansman), and this is his first big blockbuster appearance, so his inexperience didn't help him through these moments.

However, he ends up being a fine protagonist (no pun intended). Robert Pattinson is charming and quite funny, actually. I couldn't avoid the ""humorless"" review headlines, and being totally honest, it's surprisingly a lot funnier than I thought it would (not) be. His character has a vital role in the whole story, and it's through him that most of the knowledge about the intricate concept at hand is developed. Elizabeth Debicki is probably the spotlight stealer, though. With a remarkable performance, she represents the emotional arc of the film, and she delivers one of her best interpretations ever. I was afraid that her storyline would turn into a forced romance, but fortunately, it only helped build Washington's character traits.

On the other hand, Kenneth Branagh plays a cliche Russian bad guy with generic motivations who feels way too formulaic for such a ground-breaking movie. But ultimately, that's what Nolan presents. His astonishingly talented methods as a director and his obsession with detail as a writer make Tenet a certainly flawed yet phenomenal film with a concept that might be the hardest he's ever had to pull off. As long as people can remove themselves from the real world and enter a whole new one with entirely different mechanisms and rules, it will be the so-called ""blockbuster of the summer"" that everyone deserves this year.

All in all, Tenet undoubtedly boasts an incredibly complex narrative with a unique temporal concept impressively demonstrated through spectacular, loud, jaw-dropping, practical action set pieces. Christopher Nolan is a masterful director and a fascinating writer, but he has to thank its technical crew for creating such a visually stunning blockbuster. From Hoyte van Hoytema's riveting camera work to Jennifer Lame's seamless editing, passing through Ludwig Göransson's powerful score and Nathan Crowley's beautiful production design, Tenet is one of the most technically mind-blowing movies of the last few years. With the help of a remarkable cast (especially Debicki and Pattinson), the definitely intriguing story makes the epic runtime feel a bit shorter, despite some scenes being unnecessary. The heavy and forced exposition throughout the entire film transforms an otherwise entertaining flick into a fictional physics class that will confuse thousands of viewers. It also doesn't help to have a generic MacGuffin and a formulaic villain at the core of such an unconventional movie. In the end, Nolan isn't the ""savior of cinema"" (no one will be), but he certainly delivers the blockbuster everyone's been waiting for since the beginning of the year. As long as people are able to accept and enter his new world, Tenet will be received as one of the best films of 2020.

Tenet,Simon Massey,"There is a moment midway through this film where you can suddenly feel everything clicking into place. Up until this point, the film has been entertaining, with some great set pieces and a scope that is trademark Nolan, but the central hook of the film - “time inversion” - has felt almost superfluous to the plot, albeit a clever visual conceit that gives the film a different vibe to your average spy thriller. But then comes the “moment” - a simple act of crossing a threshold - where suddenly you realise how the visual conceit is going to figure into the rest of the film and also how most of the first hour has been pure setup for what is to follow. It’s the kind of twist that isn’t really a twist at all as it is a visual explanation that the film has really been waiting for. Nolan has taken quite a gamble in delaying this “moment” for so long and there is always the feeling the film is hiding elements of the plot in the first half. This means the explanation may have come too late for some to invest in the film fully, but if you are still with it, there is a sudden feeling of exhilaration of knowing to an extent some of what is about to follow and the film lets loose with some fantastic set pieces that are hugely satisfying if you have been paying attention.

Performances are great, with Branagh in full scenery chewing mode and the score is suitably Zimmeresque and loud. It doesn’t quite hit the highs of its closest cousin - Inception - but it’s scope is similarly impressive and it’s going to lead to plenty of theories and explanations in order to follow each major character’s journey through the film. Great stuff in the end, but it was touch and go there for a while.",9.0
Tenet,Daniel,"I was recently asked if this was better or worse than Inception. 
 Personally, I don’t think you can compare any of his films outside the fact that he made them. Like those made by Tarantino, each film is its own living masterpiece ...

>_The laws of science do not distinguish between the past and the future. More precisely, the laws of science are unchanged under the combination of operations (or symmetries) known as C, P, and T (C means changing particles for antiparticles. P means taking the mirror image, so left and right are interchanged. And T means reversing the direction of motion of all particles: in effect, running the motion backward). The laws of science that govern the behaviour of matter under all normal situations are unchanged under the combination of the two operations C and P on their own. In other words, life would be just the same for the inhabitants of another planet who were both mirror images of us and who were made of antimatter, rather than matter._

>_If the laws of science are unchanged by the combination of operations C and P, and also by the combination C, P, and T, they must also be unchanged under the operation T alone. Yet there is a big difference between the forward and backward directions of real time in ordinary life. Imagine a cup of water falling off a table and breaking into pieces on the floor. If you take a film of this, you can easily tell whether it is being run forward or backward. If you run it backward you will see the pieces suddenly gather themselves together off the floor and jump back to form a whole cup on the table. You can tell that the film is being run backward because this kind of behaviour is never observed in ordinary life._

>_The explanation that is usually given as to why we don't see broken cups gathering themselves together off the floor and jumping back onto the table is that it is forbidden by the second law of thermodynamics. This says that in any closed system, disorder, or entropy, always increases with time. In other words, it is a form of Murphy's law: things always tend to go wrong! An intact cup on the table is a state of high order, but a broken cup on the floor is a disordered state. One can go readily from the cup on the table in the past to the broken cup on the floor in the future, but not the other way round._

Time reversal can be thought of the same way as motion reversal: if the rules are the same whether you run the clock forwards or backwards, there's true T-symmetry.

Watching _Tenet_, the latest film from writer/producer/director Christopher Nolan (_Memento_; _Inception_; _Interstellar_), I was reminded of an apocryphal story about NASA – during the space race, in an attempt to tackle the problem of how to write in zero gravity, NASA poured millions into developing the Fisher Space Pen, whereas the Russians simply gave their cosmonauts pencils. And it seems to me watching this overblown mess of a film that Nolan has become so fixated on the grandiosity of the pen that he has completely overlooked the humble pencil. More so than any of his previous work, _Tenet_ is focused on mixing philosophy and real(ish) science with over-the-top mainstream entertainment to such an extent that he ignores such basic narrative principles as character arcs, empathy, motivation, and interiority. Now, don't get me wrong, I love filmic experimentation (two of my favourite directors are Terrence Malick and David Lynch), but _Tenet_ isn't an especially experimental film – it's a humourless and badly written shambles, convinced of its own portentousness, and created by a man who has achieved such popularity that it seems no one in his circle is willing to tell him when something is a bad idea.

Spending almost ten years working on the story, and five writing the script, in Tenet, Nolan is yet again examining the vagaries of time. It's a theme that's front and centre in _Memento_ (2000), _Inception_ (2010), _Interstellar_ (2014), and _Dunkirk_ (2017), and to a lesser extent in _Following_ (1998) and _The Prestige_ (2006) (I haven't seen any of his _Dark Knight_ trilogy so I can't attest to their thematic concerns, and we shall not speak of his remake of _Insomnia_). It's undeniably fascinating to see a tent pole Hollywood production engaging with issues such as entropy, thermodynamics, reversibility and irreversibility, time's arrow, the grandfather paradox, and T-symmetry, all the while keeping proceedings housed firmly within the spy genre (it's a Bond movie in all but name). Indeed, one of the film's central questions is especially noteworthy – if what and who we remember from our past defines who we are in our present, do things that haven't happened to us yet also speak to our identity? Do our future actions determine who we are as much as our past actions? It's a fascinating question. And one with which Nolan does precisely nothing. However, the film's main problems aren't related to the squandered existential potential, the much-ballyhooed complexity, the puzzle-like structure, the philosophical musing, or the thematic similarity to Nolan's previous work. Rather, they are more fundamental, existing almost entirely at a structural level (although some of the performances don't help matters, nor does the abysmal sound mixing). The film looks incredible, the practical effects in the action scenes are extraordinarily mounted, the cinematography is stunning, and the editing is superb, but there simply isn't anything of note under the shiny veneer. It's a film with virtually no interest in human beings.

The premise of _Tenet_ is straightforward in outline. The film opens as a CIA operative known only as The Protagonist (John David Washington) infiltrates a team of bad guys looking to find a spy at the Kiev Opera House. He finds the man before they do, but during their escape, he sees something which should be impossible – a bullet seems to travel backwards in space and a bullet hole is ""un-shot"", as if time is reversed for that bullet, even though everything else is moving normally. The Protagonist is able to smuggle the spy outside, but their escape goes awry, and to avoid being captured, he swallows a cyanide tablet. Rather than dying, however, he awakens to be told that he has passed the test to join an ultra-secret international espionage squad known as Tenet. His mission is fairly simply – at some point in the future, someone has figured out how to reverse the entropy of objects, effectively being able to send them back along the timeline without having to reverse time itself. The implications of this are catastrophic and have set humanity on course for World War III, and probable extinction, unless The Protagonist can figure out who is doing it and put a stop to their machinations. Along the way, he makes the acquaintance of Neil (Robert Pattinson), his infinitely better-informed handler; Andrei Sator (a spectacularly miscast Kenneth Branagh giving new meaning to clichéd villainy), a dangerous Russian oligarch; Kat Barton (Elizabeth Debicki), Andrei's oppressed and deeply unhappy trophy wife; Priya (Dimple Kapadia), an arms dealer; Ives (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), a Tenet soldier; Michael Crosby (Michael Caine), a British intelligence bigwig; and Barbara (Clémence Poésy), a scientist specialising in all things temporal.

_Tenet_ is an event movie in every way; this 150-minute, $200m+ original idea (when was the last time a non-franchise, non-comic book original movie got that kind of budget) is a massive studio tent pole written and directed by the most popular filmmaker alive. And I will say this. The budget is on the screen. Oftentimes, you'll see a movie that's cost a ridiculous amount and you'll sit there thinking, ""they must have spent a lot on catering."" With _Tenet_, however, it's all there, front and centre. No small amount of that money, of course, must have gone on the practical effects (incredibly, the film has only 280 vfx shots) – whether it be our heroes bungie-jumping onto the side of a building, a close-quarters fight where one of the combatants moves in reverse, a Boeing 747 jet crashing into a building (which was shot for real), a highway chase where some of the cars are going forward in time and others are going backwards, or an all-out battle scene where, again, some of the soldiers travel forward whilst others move in reverse. Even Ludwig Göransson's score gets in on the act, employing only melodies which sound the same whether played backwards or forwards.

As cinematic spectacle goes (on a purely visual level), I've never quite seen anything like it. It's one of those films where you'll genuinely be asking yourself, ""how the hell did they do that?""; a question that's become increasingly rare in our CGI-reliant times. Tenet looks like it was an exceptionally difficult movie to make. Along the same lines, the cinematography by the great Hoyte van Hoytema (_The Fighter_; _Spectre_; _Ad Astra_) is stunning, with van Hoytema mixing 15-perf 70mm IMAX film (shot at 1.43:1; projected at 1.90:1) with traditional 70mm stock (2.20:1) and a few 35mm sequences in a manner where the shifts in aspect ratio are barely noticeable (although I saw it on an IMAX screen; aspects shifts would be more obvious on a smaller screen). It's the kind of film that could only exist in the medium of cinema – no other artform could even begin to approximate its aesthetic design and splendour, and I admire that a great deal. A celluloid purist, Nolan has always made a big stink about the artistic importance of cinema, and _Tenet_ finds him pushing the aesthetic boundaries of what the artform can accomplish, foregrounding innovation in ways that big budget mainstream studio productions simply don't, and celebrating the possibilities it affords those with sufficient enough imagination.

Unfortunately, no matter how visually unique or aesthetically impressive it may be, no amount of gloss can hide the fact that the screenplay is a turgid mess and suffers from some fundamental problems – most notably, it's bereft of emotion and populated with cardboard cut-outs that are supposed to be characters. The problems start early when The Protagonist is told that the future of humanity depends on his mission. This is precisely when I started to tune out. Any film that declares its story is none-other than saving humanity has gone so big as to render the people who populate its narrative as insignificant. It's also a cliché, it's dull as dishwater, and we've seen it done a million-and-one-times. The idea of saving all mankind simply doesn't pack any kind of emotional punch any more, far better to stay smaller and focus on character.

Which brings me to those characters. Good lord, they're badly written. The Protagonist isn't a person with an interiority; he's a cipher, the audience's surrogate so that Nolan can explain the plot to us. But there's nothing more to him – he's utterly emotionless, seemingly void of any kind of relatable motivation, has no psychological through line, and nothing even resembling a character arc. I'm not a huge fan of Washington in general, who I feel has played every part in the same sombre, disinterested manner, so there could be some prejudice at work, but I am a huge fan of Branagh, and he's even worse. Think of the most clichéd Russian villain you've ever seen. Now square that and you'll be some way towards imagining how ludicrous Sator is. He isn't a person – he's a collection of near-satirical tics, clichés, and elements from other, better films. Maybe with a more menacing actor in the role it might have worked, but all I could think whenever he was on screen was ""that accent is hilarious."" Pattinson's Neil and Debicki's Kat fair better, but neither set the screen alight. Along the same lines, much of the second half of the film hinges on the fact that The Protagonist and Kat find themselves drawn to one another, yet Washington and Debicki have zero chemistry. At a human level, there's nothing to take a hold of the audience, nothing to make us care about any of these people; they're gears in the machinery of Nolan's plot.

Speaking of Kat, a common criticism of Nolan's filmography as a whole is that his female characters tend to be victims whose deaths motivate men or who need saving by men, and/or women who define themselves almost entirely in terms of their relationship to men. Now, I'm not saying that Nolan is _obliged_ to write more rounded female characters. He isn't. Much like one of his favourite filmmakers, Michael Mann, Nolan's films are androcentric. And there's nothing wrong with that. However, in Mann, there are to be found strong female characters with considerable agency, whereas in _Tenet_, Kat is nothing more than a pawn in a game played by powerful men who effortlessly control her. She defines herself almost entirely in terms of her role as a self-sacrificing mother, and whilst this is an interesting trait the first couple of times it comes up, by the time Nolan is reminding us of how much she has sacrificed for the 237th time, it had become obvious that this was going to be the extent of her characterisation.

At one point early in the film, Barbara tells The Protagonist, ""_don't try to understand it, just feel it_"", which is advice that Nolan is also offering to his audience. The problem is that there's nothing to feel. _Tenet_ is a puzzle, the impenetrability of which will depend on each individual viewer (and how much of the appallingly poorly-mixed dialogue you can make out), but unlike _Memento_ (which remains Nolan's best by a long way), which packed a seriously emotional gut-punch when we finally learn what was at the heart of the puzzle, _Tenet_ offers us nothing more than the task of deciphering it for its own sake. There's a twist towards the end that I literally saw coming from about 10 minutes in, but aside from that, there's no payoff. There's nothing to make us want to penetrate a story that seems more intent on reminding us how clever it is instead of trying to depict real people or establish real emotional stakes; it's a film more enamoured by the complexity of its own design than by any of the people contained within. It's an emotional void – all technical virtuosity and surface sheen with next to nothing at its core.",2.0

Tenet,Arshia Borjali,"Nolan's latest movie is one of his worst. An exaggerated film whose only purpose is to complicate the viewer, but I wish he could do it with cinema. These ambiguities are created only by the chaotic and crowded montage and a series of theoretical dialogues, and no cinema is seen in it. Also, we do not see any coherent story during the film and the events of the film do not form a script at all. There is no characterization in the film, the protagonist character is not made at all and is not believable, also the other characters are completely caricatured and extra, also during the film and its artificial communication, not a bit of feeling is created. Aside from the fact that the film does not even come close to form, it is also very beginner in terms of technique, excessive cuts, and sometimes weird and inappropriate! The opening and closing sequences of the film are highly artificial, and the final sequence is saturated with a large number of cuts, aerial shots and rudimentary special effects. The only slight positive aspect of the film is its acting, and the acting of the antagonist character is defensible. In general, the film is considered to be a very bad and weak film, which is like a puzzle without a pattern, meaning that after putting the white pieces together, which is not a difficult task, it has nothing to offer.",1.0

Tenet,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"It was a long time since I watched a new blockbuster movie and, mostly for personal reasons, even longer since I actually reviewed a movie, blockbuster or not.

I guess this movie is not the most simple one to pick to get my reviews/blogging back on track but there’s not that much new movies to chose from this year with the pandemic and all.

I have to say that I approached this movie with some hesitation and perhaps with an assumption that I wouldn’t like it since I have an aversion towards time travel in movies and books. It is more often than not that the author gets it more or less spectacularly wrong and it turns into a mess.

Well, I have to say that, in my mind, this movie was a bit of a mess. I felt confused and found it difficult to follow the various twists more than once. Also, at least in the beginning, the parts about bullets jumping up in your hand instead of falling out because the bullets where travelling backwards in time sounded somewhat unbelievable to me. I can accept something travelling backwards in time but for such a bullet to jump up into someone’s hand, seemingly on command, no I do not think that’s very believable at all.

Once I had watched the entire movie to the end, then finally, some of the first parts started to make sense. Personally I don’t like that I spend a large part of the movie wondering what the f… even if it (mostly) becomes clear towards the end.

However, I have to say, it was a quite cool mess.

First of all, I quite like the main protagonist. Whether he’s traveling forwards or backwards he kicks ass and he’s intelligent. He is very much a James Bond type of character which I like.

There’s also a shitload of action in this movie and it is both well done as well as cool. Of course, with the budget this movie had I would really be disappointed if there wasn’t good special effects in it. However, one thing that made the effects and action to stand out in this movie compared was this concept that for some people, and objects as well, time moved backwards. Watching some of the larger scenes where some explosions where actually explosions and some where implosions. Cars moving both forwards and backwards in car chases etc. etc. I have opinions about the plausibility of that but it looked cool at least.

For me the enjoyment of this movie was the main protagonist which I liked and the cool action. The story itself and its rather convoluted (but original I have to say that) time travel concept, well I’m not sure I was (am) too trilled about that except for the fact that it allowed these rather original special effects.",7.0
Tenet,sporkproductions,"Appreciated this film more than any Nolan film since The Dark Knight. Usually his films aim for high concept but get weighed down by syrupy schmaltz. This one ditches his unconvincing attempts at emotional/philosophical depth and just focuses on the very creative core concept of inverted time. There's no labored soliloquies about the power of love, no epic aspirations of cultural poignancy - it's mainly just a bunch of exposition interspersed between some truly breathtaking visual and audio spectacle like nothing else. 

Nolan is an artist first and foremost. His films always have a level of craft that is beyond comprehension for mere mortals like me. And in this one he turns that up to eleven. Honestly, I actually enjoyed the challenging sound design. It reminded me of the film Primer (another time bending mind melter) where the discussions about complicated ideas are drowned out by background noise and music because he knows we won't understand and it's not important anyway. What is important is that we ""feel it"" (as is literally said). 

Don't try to figure it out. Just enjoy that an arthouse abstractionist who somehow gets 100+ million dollar budgets to make quirky stories with set pieces that will blow your mind.",7.0

Tenet,Nathan,"Tenet on paper is a super interesting that I think I would have a great time with, but the execution fell flat on its face. The entire plot is so purposefully convoluted that it is really hard to follow. Christopher Nolan whips from one scene to another so fast to cram as much exposition in that so many moments just got right over the audience's head. Half the scenes are just exposition dumps with audio so poorly done that you have to read the subtitles the entire time to even understand what they're saying. The acting is all fine in this movie, but I spent so much time trying to understand the film that any mishaps could have gone right over my head. The only redeeming aspect of this film is the fights and heists. These scenes were filmed with incredible precision that really showed off the scope that the protagonist was trying to accomplish. I had a good time with that, but that was few and far between.

Tenet,Ahmetaslan27,"Christopher Nolan is a crazy and insane person. There is no dispute about this. What Nolan is trying to convey to the viewers is an adventure that is difficult to imagine on your own. It is also difficult to imagine its events and facts. It is also difficult to photograph many moments. Fear that my mind will be distracted by this wonderful drama.

The story of the film is about the attempt of some people to stop the end of the world. This person is known in this film as the Protagonist, as he does not know anything about the mission or how to end the world except for one word, which is Tenet, and the meaning of this word will appear through the events of the film, but frankly, the aesthetic of talking about this film lies In penetrating the events and talking comfortably about the events of the movie.

The photography was aesthetic with things that neither the mind nor the eye could have expected while you were sitting in front of the screen. The photographic ability in this film exceeded many stages and reached a stage of dazzling. It exceeded the choice of angles or even the duration of the shot. We have different dimensions and a new method in how to photograph.

The aesthetic of the story is not in asking ourselves what the story is. The aesthetic of the story is in how the story is told and explained. The narrative of the story and the photographic capabilities greatly exceeded the events of the story and anything else in the film, where scientific and physical facts and theories were used that greatly assist in storytelling. They greatly help in explaining the events and how they pass. Events and these scientific theories and physical facts that boggle your mind and drive you crazy have made my eyes stop closing while my time to sleep came.",8.0

The Color Purple,CinemaSerf,"Sometimes it's better just not to re-imagine/invent/devise a feature that had such a visceral impact not just on the cinema, but on the theatre and, of course - the literary world in the first place. I""m not sure this isn't one of those. It follows the story of the young ""Celie"" who is essentially sold to a neighbour ""Mister"" (Colman Domingo) when she's barely into adulthood - for a cow and some eggs. Turns out his hale-fellow-well-met character is a bit deceptive: he's a bit of a misogynist brute who sees this woman as his property. With her now the plaything of another man, her sister ""Nettie"" becomes the latest object of the desires of their father and in panic she flees to ""Celie"" for help. Out of the frying pan into the fire, perhaps - she has soon to get away from there whilst the men folk continue as if nothing has happened. The chronology speeds up a bit now and we find ourselves dipping in at various stages of their lives only discover that little has changed and their opportunities are still tied by their apron strings. Until, that is, the arrival of the jazz sensation that is ""Shug Avery"" (Taraji P. Henson) who brings with her the winds of quite empowering change. Meantime, ""Harpo"" - the stepson of ""Celie"" has found himself a rather feisty and independently-minded wife in ""Sofia"" (Danielle Brooks) and we start to think that perhaps things might just be about to improve. The only abject lesson in racism to feature here occurs around this point demonstrating the cruelty and brutality that made this story abhorrently poignant in the first place. What now ensues instils a growing determination among these women to assert themselves and thrive on their own terms. Can they? What I found this lacked was the earthiness, the grittiness, the squalor of the 1985 screen version. It's also a musical at times but a pretty sterile and overly choreographed one that seemed to be unsure if it wanted to be ""West Side Story"" or ""Washington Heights"". There's an ensemble number by a waterfall with the water flowing with almost symmetrical and flawless evenness. Even the scenes of evil are somehow just a bit too de-sensitised. I think possibly the problem for me was that the powerful performance of Fantasia Barrino was just too good, and the power balled from her towards the end presented almost as if there were space for applause afterwards. Domingo is a good actor, too, but again here he just didn't cut it as either the charismatic charmer or the sexually rapacious bully - though he did fare a little better as the story moved on. The soundtrack has some belters and taken in isolation, there are some great performances here from Barrino, Henson and my favourite - Brooks; but I'd sooner watch the original, any day - it has more authenticity in it's impact.",6.0
The Color Purple,r96sk,"A film of quality, this.

<em>'The Color Purple'</em> is a blast, what is a noteworthy thing for me to say given I'm not a lover of musicals; though, to be fair, I'm way more into them in recent years since doing reviews... have learnt to appreciate 'em! This has good music alongside an extremely deep narrative, one that hits the feels directly. I've never seen or read any version of this story previously, but this is a great introduction to it.

The performances are stellar. Danielle Brooks is outstanding, a real emotive showing from her throughout - top notch! I also seriously enjoyed (despite the character, who is iffily 'redeemed') Colman Domingo in this 2023 picture. He and Brooks are actors I've loved in television (<em>'<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Is_the_New_Black"" rel=""nofollow"">Orange Is the New Black</a></em> and <em>'<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_the_Walking_Dead"" rel=""nofollow"">Fear the Walking Dead</a>'</em>, the latter isn't the best show but Domingo is class in it), so it's extremely pleasing to see them star on the big screen.

It's somewhat of a crime it has taken me this long in my review to mention Fantasia, who is brilliant - Phylicia Pearl Mpasi is too, btw. Taraji P. Henson, obviously, impresses as well, while Halle Bailey spearheads the rest. Nice to see David Alan Grier also, as well as (like Domingo) another <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(franchise)"" rel=""nofollow"">TWD</a> alum in Corey Hawkins (whatever happened to Heath?!).",9.0
The Color Purple,Brent Marchant,"In the interest of full disclosure, I’ve routinely made it clear that I’m not a big fan of movie musicals. In addition, less known is the fact that I’ve also never been particularly enamored with the original dramatic version of this story (1985), a picture in which director Steven Spielberg still had his training wheels on when it came to making serious cinematic fare. With those admissions in mind, then, it would appear that this latest iteration of the classic Alice Walker novel would have two prejudicial strikes against it going in, and that assessment would be accurate, as these qualifications sincerely reflect my characterization of this alternative take on this beloved tale. Director Blitz Bazawule’s musical adaptation of this tale about a young African-American woman (Fantasia Barrino) struggling to find happiness under harsh conditions in early 20th Century Georgia is plagued by an array of issues, including an ill-fitting fusion of this story in a Broadway format/context, an uneven distribution of production numbers throughout the course of the narrative, numerous over-the-top (and frequently silly) surreal song and dance sequences (many of which look like they’ve been plucked fresh from a Baz Luhrmann movie), understandable but nevertheless-disappointing plot and character development alterations, and some serious miscasting choices (such as the usually-reliable Colman Domingo, who’s decidedly out of place in the role of Mister). This combination of misfire elements makes for somewhat disappointing viewing for those who adored the book and original screen version and does little for winning over innately lukewarm supporters of the material (like me). Granted, the film gets better as it goes along (probably because there are fewer musical numbers in the second half than the first), and its ensemble cast, for the most part, is quite compelling, including Barrino, Taraji P. Henson, David Alan Grier, Corey Hawkins and Oscar nominee Danielle Brooks. However, on balance, this is one of those projects where things probably would have been better off left alone.",6.0

Next Goal Wins,Chris Sawin,"A story with all the proper beats lives here, even if the film rambles and tampers off into ridiculousness when it has no reason to. But even with its flaws and redundant humor fatigue, _Next Goal Wins_ stands out as Taika Waititi’s most coherent film since Hunt for the Wilderpeople.

Next Goal Wins,CinemaSerf,"If you've seen ""12 Mighty Orphans"" (2021) or ""The Shiny Shrimps"" (2019) then you'll know what to expect as Taika Waititi takes the same template and applies it to football. Here it's the adequate Michael Fassbender who gets to portray the down on his luck coach (Thomas Rongen) in this factually based story. He's not much good at his job and is temperamentally a bit unreliable, so is dispatched to coach what is officially the world's worst team. American Samoa, still smarting from a 31-0 thumping at the hands of the ever so slightly more populated Australia, has a team whose viability is under scrutiny by the parent American Federation. Can Rongen turn things around? His team are the traditionally disparate group of well-meaning, distinctly amateur, enthusiasts. Unused to any concept of team playing, co-ordination and/or training - and their new boss's predilection for a bottle or two doesn't suggest change is going to come anytime soon. Local federation boss Tavita (Oscar Kightley) manages to inspire though - and what happens now is all rather predictable, but engagingly portrayed, as the team start to realise that defeat each time is not as inevitable as they might expect. It does present us with quite an interesting look at Polynesian attitudes - ones of compassion, fairness and tolerance. Winning is important, but it's not the be all and end all; and the eventual make up of their team - and it's constituent parts - is testament to a society that has way more right than it has wrong in the way it thinks and behaves. There's loads of humour - most of which comes from an on-form Kightley, but I found that a bit weak and just a little too stereotypical (albeit from their perspective rather than the American's). The best bits are probably in the trailers, but it's still just about worth a watch - but the television will be fine.",6.0
Next Goal Wins,r96sk,"The last chunk of the film saves it somewhat, prior to that <em>'Next Goal Wins'</em> is quite poor.

I like Taika Waititi and usually dig his humour a lot, but here his comedy put into the flick just isn't all that amusing annoyingly. I'm a big football fan so knew of the real life story that this is based upon, though even as such it kinda sits in the middle of being for sports fans and being for the average moviegoer... without really committing to either, at least that's how it felt to me; it's not comedic enough or sporty enough.

I found everything until the scene with a smiley face on the whiteboard to be real lame, like nothing I was watching was entertaining me... kinda cringey, if anything. A lot of the humour up to that moment felt forced, in fact the only parts that got a chuckle out of me were the white guy jokes. Michael Fassbender isn't any good up to that point, either.

Thankfully, the conclusion is fairly feel-good and does wrap things up well - to the point it gets an extra notch up with my rating. As noted I found Fassbender average, at best... Liam Neeson might've been a better cast, especially given they allude to a past role of the Northern Irishman's at one moment. Away from the lead, other cast members do do decent - namely Oscar Kightley, Kaimana and David Fane.

It feels a touch like the filmmakers were aiming to retread the path that opened via <em>'<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Lasso"" rel=""nofollow"">Ted Lasso</a>'</em>. I'm not into that television show, though safe to say it does a better job... if the similarity is a fair one on my part. <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/bend-it-like-beckham/"" rel=""nofollow"">Bend It Like Beckham</a>'</em> is a shout also, but that comparison is probably me reaching in fairness.",6.0
Origin,Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/origin-venice-film-festival-review-a-must-see-educational-story/

""Origin brilliantly transposes the pillars of caste from Isabel Wilkerson's book to the big screen through an incredibly revealing, genuinely fascinating narrative, despite becoming clear that the source material is better suited to a documentary.

The exceptionally human performances of the entire cast, especially Aunjanue Ellis, compensate for some lack of balance between emotionally personal dialogues and weighty lectures. Impactful imagery and an extremely stirring score make the audiovisual experience even more captivating.

It's not without issues, but it's one of the most important stories to watch/read this century.""

Rating: B",7.0
Origin,CinemaSerf,"The acting is all really quite adequate here, but it's not really that important to the fascinating underlying premiss that underpins the theory that race, in itself, might not be the reasons for the hierarchical nature of a society that always manages to create sub-classes. Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor offers her own engaging perspective on author Isabel Wilkerson who is invited by a publisher to offer a more considered and less reactionary appraisal of race relations following the murder of a young black man who just happened to be in the wrong place (a white neighbourhood) at the wrong time. The audience know full well from the outset what has happened here, so that's not especially important to the plot either - it's her search for a rationale. That search attempts to draw parallels between the plight of the African American citizenry with the victims of Holocaust and of the system of caste that prevails in India. By spending a section of the film in Germany and then in India, we are exposed to a more internationalist view of just why society is made up of the have lots, the haves and the have nots - and at just how little much of that has changed for centuries. The comparison she develops works surprisingly convincingly, if not without it's flaws, and Ellis-Taylor acts well as a sort of sponge for the philosophies that emerge. The one element that it rather studiously avoids is religion. That isolation does rather compromise the authenticity of any conclusion as it doesn't acknowledge that so often the behaviour and structures of cultures are dictated by those atop them in some form of priesthood - whether they be Brahmin or Cardinal. There are a few familial sub-plots to add a bit of drama to the story, but I found them a little unnecessary as the theory elaborates more. It does come from a very specific American perspective - I'd be interested to see how it might turn out if it were to be remade from a Jewish of Indian point of view, but as it is - it's a thoughtful exercise in what makes human strata function and endure.",7.0
Origin,Brent Marchant,"Those who believe that institutionalized systemic racism is fundamentally an American problem should probably give a serious look to this latest offering from writer-director Ava DuVernay, best known for the superb historical drama, “Selma” (2014). Based on the book Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents by best-selling author Isabel Wilkerson, the film examines how organic prejudices are actually a worldwide phenomenon that may or may not have anything specifically to do with race but are more readily attributable to matters of caste. While the picture indeed examines this practice from an American perspective, it also addresses it from the standpoint of the dictates employed in Nazi Germany and in the longstanding Indian caste system, where race was/is not an inherent issue. Rather, the institutionalized discriminatory practices in these locales (as well as in others) were (and in some cases still are) driven by the implementation of artificial distinctions that have been established and perpetuated based on other characteristics but that have had the same kinds of negative impact as those driven by race-based policies. The filmmaker explores how author Wilkerson (Aunjanue Ellis Taylor) went about researching and writing the book on this subject, a project undertaken at a time when she was dealing with the fallout from a series of personal tragedies involving her mother (Emily Yancy), husband (Jon Bernthal) and cousin (Niecy Nash-Betts), giving her a reason to pick herself up and carry on with her life. Admittedly, the multiple story threads involved in the narrative and the way in which they’re organized could have used some tweaking for greater clarity and smoother connectedness, and the author’s theories could have stood to be presented a little less overly intellectually at times. However, in the end, the movie’s themes successfully come together to create a captivating and eye-opening hypothesis that we’d all be wise to consider seriously. What’s more, the depiction of Wilkerson’s personal story is filled with a series of strongly emotive moments that are sure to tug heartily at the heart strings, so keep the hankies handy. The film also features an array of fine, small-role supporting performances from the likes of Nick Offerman, Blair Underwood, Audra McDonald, Finn Whitrock, Vera Farmiga, Myles Frost and Lennox Simms. In the end, the revelations exposed here could well make you sad for the needlessly sorry state of humanity. But the picture also provides a deeper, more insightful understanding of what’s fundamentally wrong with humanity, providing us with a key that just might help us find our way out of the current social morass with a solution that could potentially help us finally fix things for good.",8.0
Fallen Leaves,CinemaSerf,"There's a lovely scene in this film where ""Holappa"" (Jussi Vatanen) and his mate are in an Helsinki karaoke bar staffed by a motionless barman who looks like he's straight out a zombie movie! Talking of zombie movies, the story follows the lives of this fellow and of ""Ansa"" (Alma Pöysti) whose first date at the local ""Ritz"" cinema is ecactly that - unlikely fodder for a burgeoning romance - even if their post film chat afterwards is under the gaze of a ""Brief Encounter"" poster. She has recently been fired for pinching some out-of-date food from the supermarket in which she worked. He's been fired a few times for too many vodka breaks at work. Her latest boss is arrested for drug dealing and that's when they first meet. They click, they go for a coffee - then that cinema trip ensues. Thing is, she has views on excessive drinking - it has profoundly affected members of her family. He's a bit of an ass about that - but perhaps she's had more of an impact on him than he realised. Maybe he can give up? Maybe she'll give him another chance? The humour here is plentiful but really quite dark and subtle. There are plot developments that we probably ought not to laugh at, but we do - and the ending leaves us hoping but not knowing. It's not exactly laugh out loud but you'll get plenty to smile about if you keep your wits about you for eighty minutes. Perhaps not a film the Finnish Culture Ministry would be too fond of - but I enjoyed it.",7.0
Fallen Leaves,Brent Marchant,"It’s not much of a secret that the worldview of Finnish society can be more than a little bleak. At the same time, though, it also possesses an understatedly campy, eminently whimsical quality that comes in stark contrast to this otherwise-dour outlook. And this makes for a combination of traits that can be somewhat puzzling to fathom, especially to outsiders. That’s the quirky social conundrum that writer-director Aki Kaurismäki seeks to capture in his latest offering, a wry comedy-drama focused on the lives of two lonely, lovelorn working class Helsinki residents (Alma Pöysti, Jussi Vatanen) who struggle against life’s hiccups while seeking to forge a romance. But, in telling their story, the filmmaker has difficulty finding sufficient traction to engage viewers. We witness a story full of modest, garden variety ups and downs, as well as more than a few miscommunications, experiences we’ve all no doubt undergone ourselves from time to time. However, is that enough to make a compelling picture? It certainly doesn’t feel that way much of the time, given its wooden dialogue and restrained, sometimes-stilted performances, no matter how pointedly this production may portray the nature of this extraordinarily reserved people. To its credit, the film works best when it pokes fun at the nature of Finnish culture, providing some delicious nuggets of droll humor, backed by a diverse yet spot-on soundtrack that fittingly and ironically complements what’s unfolding on screen. Nevertheless, there’s so much here that lends so little to a narrative that just never catches fire that it’s hard to imagine almost anyone generating any interest in, or enthusiasm for, the protagonists and their feeble attempts at launching a relationship. Maybe I’m missing something here, but, if there is something meaningful that this release is trying to convey, it’s apparently well buried under one of those big piles of fallen leaves that give this picture its title.",5.0
Fallen Leaves,BornKnight,"German-Finnish drama / romance by the director  Aki Kaurismäki, continuation of his Proletariat series, which was originally planned as a trilogy and already includes Shadows in Paradise (1986), Ariel (1988), and The Match Factory Girl (1990).

With simple stories in a stylized Helsinki that seems to be stopped at the end of the 80´s on purpose (although your hear on the radio about the current Russia and Ukraine War, and see a 2024 calendar) it tells about the love story in simple lines of melancholy about two workers, a construction area man and a woman that worked on supermarkets and factories. Think of a Finnish Wes Anderson.

The lines of the story are simple as the concept, of a couple that have some mismatches around the way till the final encounter, but this simpliness, slow-paced sweetness in the context of the depression and melancholy of the lives and city is what colours the film in the end. Contributing to this sweetness it includes the changes on each other character along the movie in simple steps.

The movie premiered on 76th Cannes Film Festival, and was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or in its main competition section, where it won the Jury Prize and will be the contender for the 96th Academy award for best international movie.

Knowing what to expect of the movie I gave him a 7,6 out of 10,0 score, or a B+ as I always prefer more complex stories.",7.0
Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms,CinemaSerf,"As with any film that's the first in a trilogy, this spends just a little too long setting out who's who but once it does, this develops into an enjoyable fantasy adventure film that brings a wonderfully vibrant myriad of Chinese mythological and human characters to life. Ancient rivalries and battles between humanity, the deities and some marvellously created mystical beasts - especially the dragons - form the basis of the story set some three millennia ago. Personally, I tended to the side of the immortals - and there's even the slightest hint of a bromance for one of them - as the ""Demon Fox"", and the manipulative ""King Zhou"" use mankind's greed, avarice, loyalty and decency to ensure they retain their place at the top of the mountain. The visual effects are usually top drawer and the action scenes avoid the often lazily constructed, repetitive, style of combat scenes. Now the acting isn't the best - indeed there is plenty of woodenness for us to inspect here, and I also found it a bit over-scored, but the richness of the mythology could, a bit like ""Lord of the Rings"", perhaps, provide for more characterful adventures and personality development in the next film. For a part one, though, it's a long, but increasingly quite compelling watch if you like the genre and appreciate the wealth of stories before us. Get comfy though - we're in for a long ride!",7.0

Donnie Darko,Wuchak,"***Cult flick with sophisticated themes, great cast, but meh story***

Released in 2001 and written/directed by Richard Kelly, ""Donnie Darko"" is a drama/fantasy starring Jake Gyllenhaal as a troubled California teen dogged by apparitions of a man in an evil rabbit suit who manipulates him to commit several crimes, after he narrowly escapes a peculiar accident concerning a jet engine falling from the sky. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays his sister, Holmes Osborne & Mary McDonnell his parents, Drew Barrymore his teacher, Katharine Ross his therapist, Jena Malone his girlfriend, Noah Wyle his science teacher and Patrick Swayze a self-help guru. Patience Cleveland is on hand as Grandma Death.

While the movie flopped at the box office, it has since become a serious cult hit. I saw it recently for the first time and went into it cold without knowing anything about the intricacies behind the plot. The only thing I knew was that the kid was harassed by an ee-vil bunny apparition. The film mildly works as a high school drama with a satirical smirk. But the story's just not engaging enough on that level. While the movie has some quality women, it fails to capitalize on their presence (Barrymore, for instance, is barely in it). But Jake is a solid protagonist, even somewhat sympathetic despite the curious things he does.

By the middle of the second act I found myself getting bored with the story and trying to figure out what was going on, but the film perks up in the last act, particularly when it reveals the truth about the scary bunny guy. After viewing, my overall impression was that the story never really took off and was burdened by perplexing ambiguities even while possessing some fascinating elements. I came up with a theory to explain the events (explained below) but, upon reflection, I realized that all the pieces didn't fit. And the movie simply wasn't entertaining enough to bang my head further trying to figure it out. I would've given the movie a mediocre 5/10 rating, but after investigating the official meaning and the alternative explanations I had to admit that the film is genius in this respect. It just needed to be attached to a more interesting story with more stimulating characters.

The film runs 113 minutes, which is the version I saw; the Director's Cut runs 20 minutes longer. It was shot in Los Angeles and surrounding areas (Angeles National Forest, Long Beach, Santa Monica, Santa Clarita, Burbank & Calabasas).

GRADE: B-

ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY (***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read unless you've seen the movie):

My casual interpretation turned out to be one of the alternative explanations of the movie, the so-called ""Donnie Is Shown the Future"" explanation, which suggests that Donne is shown the future via the future ghost of Frank and so he sacrifices himself at the end to save everyone. But, as noted above, there are too many holes in this interpretation.

A couple of other popular explanations are the banal Schizophrenia Theory, where the film shows the protagonist going through an episode of his illness, and the Dream Theory, where it was ""all just a dream,"" which is too clichéd and idiotic to even consider.

The 'official' interpretation I would've never pieced together because it's just too sci-fi-oriented and complex: It's the Tangent Universe Theory, which suggests that time in the Primary Universe (i.e. reality) is occasionally corrupted and an unstable alternative universe is created, but it will only last a few weeks. Nevertheless, it threatens to destroy the universe. The events you see happening in the bulk of the film are this alternative reality where the universe (or God) is correcting the error to get back to the Primary Universe using an Artifact (the jet engine), The Living Receiver (Jake Gyllenhaal), a Manipulated Dead person (the bunny guy), and so on. Google it and you'll see that the Tangent Universe explanation ties up all the loose ends.",6.0
Donnie Darko,Repo Jack,"A complete mind-bender of a movie that put Jake Gyllenhall on the map, introduced the creepiest rabbit costume of all time, and may make you surprisingly tear up to a remake of Tears for Fears ""Mad World.""",9.0
Donnie Darko,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**A strange film, with a strong visual impact and a script with wild theories, but which fulfills its objective very well and is enjoyable to watch.**

I saw this film very recently, and I have to agree with all those who label it “strange” or “bizarre”. Directed and written by Richard Kelly, it stars a young Jake Gyllenhaal and offers us a very complex plot where a young teenager commits several crimes under the influence of an imaginary friend who dresses up as a rabbit. Everything indicates that this young man is schizophrenic or psychotic in some way, and has developed several linked obsessions, but the film always leaves us in doubt as to whether he is, in some way, right about the things he thinks.

There are several films that follow similar scripts, where imagination and psychopathy are almost indistinguishable from reality (“Fight Club”, “Machinist”, etc.) and this is perhaps one of the most surreal because it allows us to see, from the beginning, that something is very wrong. That's a bonus for those who like these types of films because it's easy to keep our attention. Of course, those who are less fond of cinematic oddities won't have much reason to be satisfied.

And if it is true that, on a technical level, the film does not present any major innovations or surprises, it is also true that it does everything very correctly and without problems or gross errors. We can even say that, considering the budget, it is one of those films that seems more expensive than it is. In addition, we must also mention the beautiful performance of the cast, where each one seems to do what needs to be done with correctness and restraint. Gyllenhaal has the right strength and charisma for his role and does an excellent job, and Jena Malone proves to be an intelligent and well-considered addition.",6.0
City of God,Crazypiglady,"It’s a great film and well worthy of its the respect it has. It’s gruelling too, the 18 rating is due to the thread running through the film of continuous and ruthless violence of gangs trying to control their drug area. The is the story told through the eyes of ‘Rocket’ who avoids getting in to the gang war of his brother and friends by trying to find a safer life. 

The film combines slick production without losing a genuine documentary feel which I think it is why it’s so enduring. While it achieves a feeling of reality, it isn’t specifically a true story. However, the Cidade de Deus is real (being created to rehouse the slums away from Rio de Janeiro) and this story of its underworld and the film’s production makes one believe it may not be too far from the truth. There is hope in the story but not a lot.",
Beau Is Afraid,Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.firstshowing.net/2023/review-ari-asters-beau-is-afraid-warrants-the-love-hate-reception/

“Beau Is Afraid is by far Ari Aster's most complex, inaccessible film to date, although guilt, extreme anxiety, and a complicated mother-son relationship are clear themes deeply explored throughout five sections - the second is one of the most mesmerizing, visually stunning sequences of the year. The more I think about what I watched, the more I admire the unique, thought-provoking, overwhelmingly surreal storytelling by one of the most authentic voices working today.

That said, the three-hour runtime feels really heavy, the analysis of the movie as a whole raises some issues, and while all the technical departments are award-worthy, stating ""it's not for everyone"" is a perfect description of one of the most divisive films you'll see for a while.”

Rating: B-",6.0
Beau Is Afraid,Nathan,"Beau is Afraid certainly boasts an incredibly rich and intricate narrative, filled with a plethora of allegories, symbolisms, and thematic elements. However, one may question whether the complexity of the film is worth sacrificing entertainment value. In attempting to weave together these complex themes, Ari Aster has created a narrative that was very difficult for me to fully process.

During the first hour of the movie, I found myself engrossed in the story, with tense scenes that blurred the lines between what is real and what is fake. However, as the film progressed, these surreal scenes became increasingly wild and disjointed, leaving me feeling disconnected from the narrative. I found myself constantly asking questions about what was happening, how we got there, and why things were unfolding the way they were. This detachment ultimately detracted from my overall enjoyment of the film.

At three hours in length, Beau is Afraid can be a daunting task for audiences to undertake. While a well-paced film can fly by (Avatar: The Way of Water and Babylon for instance), this one felt like a slog at times, and I found myself frequently checking the clock to see how much time was left. However, despite these shortcomings, the technical execution of the film was truly exceptional. Aster's direction was brilliant, with stunning camera work and beautiful cinematography. The acting was also top-notch, with Joaquin Phoenix delivering what was arguably the best performance of the year so far. The supporting cast, including Amy Ryan, Patti LuPone, and Nathan Lane, also gave standout performances.

All in all, Beau is Afraid was quite a letdown for me. While Aster undoubtedly has a brilliant mind and a talent for storytelling, this film may have suffered from a lack of restraint. Nonetheless, the technical prowess and stellar performances are certainly noteworthy and should not be overlooked.

Verdict: Poor",4.0
Beau Is Afraid,CinemaSerf,"Right from the start we appreciate that ""Beau"" is going to have an hard time with life. Luckily we skip forwards forty years and find him living an almost siege existence in a lawless city where sirens and racket keep him awake for most of the night. It's after one such a lively night that he suddenly awakes realising that he must get to the airport to go and visit his wealthy mother. Suffice to say, events conspire and he doesn't quite make the trip... He calls to alert his mother only to get the UPS man on the phone standing over an headless corpse. His mother? Well he now has to make a journey - without a functioning credit card - in time for her funeral. What now ensue are a series of mildly entertaining but largely just too surreal escapades that marry fantasy and fiction on his trip. This is a very strong effort from Joaquin Phoenix as the gentle but almost permanently bamboozled ""Beau"". He gives himself fully to the part and engenders frustration and sympathy successfully as the story progresses - in fits and starts - towards it's conclusion. Nathan Lane chips in well - if completely over the top - too, as surgeon ""Roger"" and we save the best til last with a rather bizarre denouement that sees Patti LuPone (his mother, ""Mona"") in an whole new light. At times the writing can be witty but for me this is just way, way too long and episodic. It's as if Ari Aster had an accumulation of ideas for his character that he has, almost ""Forrest Gump"" style, stitched together in the hope that what emerges at the end has been enjoyable to watch. I'm not great at the outlandish. It's not that it needs a solid beginning, middle and end but somehow I prefer the plot to be rooted in something just a bit more tangible than this is. I am glad that I saw it in a cinema, but I can safely say I won't watch it again.",6.0
Beau Is Afraid,misubisu,"It's way too long with no coherent storyline to keep you involved or interested.

The production values are very high and the look and feel of the movie are very rich... but it's not enough to hold the three hours together.

Beau is the unluckiest person ever... and he is constantly jumping from the frying pan into the fire (and through no fault of his own). This becomes incredibly tedious.

I watched the movie in 4 parts. No way I could sit through it in one.

I've watched three hour movies that just fly by... this one went by at a snail's pace and you really felt it.",6.0
Beau Is Afraid,Horseface,"Zero spoilers in here. 

Absolutely wonderful. I can't do a big braining on what everything means in this crazy topsy-turvy roller-coaster of a movie, but it's one hell of an entertaining ride if you just sit back and enjoy it. For me, this movie needed to be watched the same way I watched Lost Highway - don't try to understand it, just be open to being frightened and entertained. 

Suffering from generalized anxiety myself, the first part of the movie is absolutely brilliant, showing the world through the lens of someone with a severe case of anxiety. Everything is over the top, and the attention to detail is stunning.

The movie devolves further and further into madness, somewhat akin to the way it did in Mother, except not in a frustrating way, but rather an action-packed and crazy, sometimes touching way. Oh, and hilarious. There are such funny moments in this movie, often absurdly so.

I didn't read up on anything before watching this movie, and I had no idea it was going to be three hours. I didn't know Ari Aster made it, and frankly I didn't know who he was. Looking it up afterwards, I see he made Midsommar, which I found tedious and boring, and Hereditary, which I absolutely loved.

I can definitely see how someone could hate this movie. I can also sympathize with being frustrated with it if trying to understand everything. I think the best way to watch this is popcorn. Watch this like you'd watch a popcorn flick, except expect absurdities instead of explosions (though we do get explosions here, too). That's how you'll be entertained by this amazing movie. I'll be watching this again.

Oh, and Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar for this performance. Absolutely his most impressive performance so far.

Watch this. It's special. Even if you hate it, you won't regret watching it.",10.0
Beau Is Afraid,BornKnight,"Not for everyone indeed. But it is A24 and Ari Aster (and yeah I am a fan of his works). It is very difficult to categorize the movie... part thriller, part abstract, part (well mostly) dark comedy. 

Who knows Ari Aster works of before (Hereditary, Midsommar) knows he likes a lot to put abstract, symbolic and allegorical scenes, and pieces of the plot hidden thorough the movie. Beau Wasserman is unique and pitiless. 

This one is surely one he put a hell of an effort to put things, and make sense in the senseless... and in chaos that is a definition for what I saw, it is pretty crazy as some flicks from the 70's (see Holy Mountain of 73, or Zardoz of 74 and you will get the LSD level of the scenes). Some more recent movies had that WTF moments too, like the middle part of Triangle of Sadness or some parts of White Noise (both of 2022) and you get the level of non-sense and comic all together.

The best definition of the Kafkaesqueness of Beau is to pick some work of the dutch painting Hieronymus Bosch of the XV century and try to grab some meaning on it. It is there but not so obvious.

In the case of Beau you can see two things: 1-) he is clearly someone with deeply psychological or psychiatric issues and 2-) he has a deep anxiety and FEAR all along the movie in the hope to not let people down or not to be a disappointment to anybody even he is clearly being it already in his mind. It is on the title of the movie.

The most ""normal"" scenes in the movie are the ones in the start of the movie in the psychiatrist bed (the ones that he must have with lot's of water - I don't know if it is a joke or not but Wass in german means ""water"" and element that is present since the beginning of the movie). 

It must be interesting to see Aster working in his works, because neither one is simple, all are complex and relates to parts that we seen before. His passion for his work makes him one of the directors I admire at the most. Some people don't like him - the same way some people don't like Lars von Trier works. It is a matter of taste, and it is totally normal.

For me the story told is all above - don't try to pick what is real and what isn't, because out of the clinic door all is in Beau's head. Fragments of reality and inner issues in a bizarre blender that isn't for everyone.

I wish I had seen it on the theater there were some scenes that made me laugh a lot and at the same time felt guilty like the one at his attic. 

On the technical side: Joaquin Phoenix again is a powerhouse in acting (and Academy worthy maybe?), the script is pretty original (well, last year Everything Everywhere All at Once was mostly non-sense but with a sense and won tons of stuff) and the work on editing and art direction are excellent and again long colaborator Pawel Pogorzelski work as cinematography is impeccable.

I liked the movie, it isn't the best of Ari Aster (and three hours are heavy on most of the cases), but is pretty good: my score is 8,3 out of 10,0 / A -.",8.0
Amélie,Siam,"Watched this movie solely because of an edit. Watching that edit made me think it would be a psycho-type of movie. However, after watching it now, I have to say it went over my head. I'm not saying it's bad; I had high expectations for it, but it couldn't deliver as much as I hoped. Nonetheless, the amount it did deliver was nice. What I liked the most about this movie is its cinematography, especially the zoom-in shots. Overall, for me, it falls into the 'good' tier. It might be because I had such high expectations for it, but it is what it is.",
The Three Musketeers: D'Artagnan,MovieGuys,"The best way I can describe this effort is a contemporised, misinterpretation, of Dumas novel. 

If, like me, you have read The Three Musketeers novel, more than once, you'll find this film largely divorced, from that work. The inconsistencies are glaring. 

The most obvious is steering this tale away from its focus on the male leads, in favour of not necessarily peripheral but definitely secondary or tertiary, female characters. Yes, in my opinion, its yet another clumsy chance to hoist the flag of feminism. Making female characters relevant to the story, in the modern woke context. Of course, this predictably, unbalances the story. The musketeers, are, nudged into the background, in the own tale. 

The second point of failure is the age of D'Artagnan, who in past films is typically played by a young male actor because this tale, in a sense, is a coming of age story. That's all swept aside too, quite possibly in service to the feminisation of the story.Instead, he's portrayed by a 33 year old man, incongruously called, ""a boy"". Suffice to say, it all feels rather awkward.

Are there any redeeming elements to the production? Obviously, the acting is sound, its a strong cast. Money has been spent on sets, settings, fight choreography and more, to try to bring this period in French history, to life.

Regrettably, so much else is wrong that this film simply feels ""openly fake"", to this reviewer. I do not see it as a loyal expression, of Dumas sterling work. Nor the period, in which it is set.

In summary,feminises an essentially masculine tale. Don't believe me, just look at the poster, not to mention the film itself. In my view  there are numerous superior and more accurate, cinematic expressions of Dumas work, on offer.",4.0
Io Capitano,Brent Marchant,"Movies about the flood of new immigrants into Europe from Africa and the Middle East have been growing in number in recent years. Depictions of the many hardships these individuals face (sometimes graphic and disturbing in nature) have been making their way into the cinematic community, showing exactly what these desperate freedom seekers are up against. And this latest offering in this genre does just that in telling the story of two Senegalese teens as they make the perilous attempt to find their way to a new life in Italy. Writer-director Matteo Garrone tells the harrowing tale of cousins Seydou (Seydou Sarr) and Moussa (Moustapha Fall) as they wrestle with the challenges of the environment, unrepentant scammers, forced detention and torture by authorities and criminals, and the harsh conditions of crossing the Mediterranean. However, while the film features fine performances, cinematography and location settings, it all seems a little too familiar, a tale with a hole-filled plot and a series of cliffhangers that seem to have all-too-convenient solutions to them. It’s also overlong, filled with a variety of sequences that could have been easily pared back without losing anything meaningful. Nevertheless, these shortcomings are countered, to a certain extent, by an intriguing mystical and surreal subtext, which is actually the picture’s strongest (though most woefully underdeveloped) aspect. In light of the foregoing, then, I must admit that I’m somewhat mystified how this release managed to secure so many accolades, including Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for best international film, especially given how many other better offerings were available. “Io Capitano” is one of those movies that makes a good instructional picture for those who’d like to know more about the plight of this new wave of immigrants, but its hype seems a bit inflated in the face of previous releases on this subject and other foreign language offerings more deserving of the praise.",6.0
Bhakshak,Ritesh Mohapatra,"BHAKSHAK on Netflix unfolds a gritty and honest narrative, exposing systemic flaws with unflinching realism.

Short Review: 

“Bhashak,"" Netflix's latest offering, courageously exposes systemic flaws inspired by the Muzaffarpur shelter home case. Director Pulkit navigates the harrowing tale with restraint, shunning sensationalism for authenticity. The film delves into the challenges faced by small-town journalists reporting on powerful crimes. Bhumi Pednekar shines as Vaishali, embodying the film's editorial voice with sincerity. Sanjay Mishra adds seasoned humor, while Aditya Srivastava and Sai Tamhankar deliver excellent support. The film, backed by Shahrukh's Red Chillies Entertainment, deserves recognition for tackling crucial narratives. With a focus on realism over dramatic highs, ""Bhashak"" stands as a testament to the importance of telling impactful stories. 

Full Review :

""Bhashak"" - the new Netflix film ventures into exposing systemic flaws without sensationalism. Loosely inspired by the 2018 Muzaffarpur shelter home case, the film feels honest for its true incident premise and realistic approach in the edit table. 

Direction: 
Director Pulkit tackles a harrowing crime against destitute children with restraint and care, focusing on authenticity rather than being dramatic. Pulkit portrays the challenges of small-town journalists grappling while reporting significant events, albeit heavy-friction from people in power.

Performances:
The protagonist, Vaishali (Bhumi Pednekar), symbolizes the film's editorial voice, navigating through ethical dilemmas and a heinous crime saga with a hard-hitting performance. She truly immerses in her character displaying honesty and sincerity. Sanjay Mishra is a veteran and he effortless sense of humour and practical performance is admirable. Aditya Srivastava and Sai Tamhankar provide fantastic support.

Is it worth a watch?
The film deserves more credit and due in Netflix, as this film is backed by Shahrukh's Res Chillies Entertainment. Kudos to him for backing such important stories that needed telling. Dont expect dramatic highs , as its as real as it can get.",

When is what we want not what we want, when does yes not really mean yes - or it means yes because you just want to get something over with, or yes because you are just curious, or yes because you are too stoked up to think anything through - and are in the arms of a charismatic person? This isn't a violent film in any graphic sense, but it does have quite an emotionally potent impact for a while as the very much on-form McKenna-Bruce juggles her outward, bouncy and lively persona, with a young woman who is still very much growing up - and vulnerable. I didn't love the last twenty minutes - they robbed the film of the much of the ambiguity that hitherto had made it poignant and a talking point. At this point the behaviour becomes just plain wrong and odious - before they all head home. This is a story about a girl, but it could just as easily be about a boy - under self and peer imposed pressures to perform/conform unaware of the longer-term consequences of sand getting everywhere. Snag for me is that the film is just too much of a fly-on-the-wall documentary for the most part. We have to wait too long before the story starts to make it's point effectively, and then I think it rather rushes and compromises the message.

20 Days in Mariupol,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**

“20 Days in Mariupol” is one of the most painful films I have ever watched: it is also one of the most important. This stunning documentary not only gives a chilling firsthand view of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it captures actual war crimes.

Due to its strategic location, Mariupol has become one of the most important regions in the war. On the eve of Russia’s invasion, Ukranian filmmaker and journalist Mstyslav Chernov and two colleagues entered the port city to cover the situation as press. When bombs began falling nearby, the team suddenly found themselves trapped in a dangerous conflict zone after the siege began. Hiding out in hospitals so they could capture footage and share it with the world, the trio spent 20 days filming this unflinching account of what was really happening to the country and her people. This documentary is an extraordinary achievement in reporting, as it fights Putin’s extensive propaganda efforts and exposes the harsh reality. His camera captures the truth (that civilians were being targeted) and exposes Russia’s lies. (After some of Chernov’s footage was shown on global news networks, Putin claimed it was staged, “fake news” — which is infuriating).

A word of warning: once you see this film, you can never go back. There are things shown here that may haunt you forever. The images of casualties and destruction are heartbreaking, upsetting, and extremely traumatic. Chernov doesn’t turn away from the most horrific scenes that he encounters, including graphic footage of bloody deaths (both human and animal) and savage wartime violence. There are close-ups of the lifeless bodies of infants, pregnant women, children, and adults. There are full morgues, mass graves, desperation, and utter despair. It’s disturbing to watch, but it also a crucial step in realizing the horrors and the true cost of war.

Chernov narrates the film with an appropriately somber tone, giving a first-hand look at what it was like during the early days of the conflict. His on-camera interviews with Ukranians will tear your heart apart, conveying the emotional harm that wartime brings. This first-person view takes audiences inside hospitals and into the emergency rooms alongside doctors, nurses, and their patients who are in need of critical care. He goes underground with locals into their makeshift basement bomb shelters, spending time with the citizens who are living the horror in real time. As Ukranians begin living without heat, electricity, internet, phones, and with hospitals beginning to run out of critical medicine, Chernov captures a sense of isolation as Mariupol’s residents are cut off from communication networks and much-needed aid.

The most controversial scenes are ones that some viewers may find tasteless, but they are also some of the most important to see. On several occasions, Chernov keeps his camera pointed on grieving parents and their dead children, even filming unsuccessful efforts of resuscitation by medical personnel. These scenes are bloody, graphic, tragic, and highly distressing, but they also foster a deeper understanding of the pain and suffering that Ukranians are going through.

Despite being extremely difficult to watch, “20 Days in Mariupol” is a film immeasurable value. It not only offers an astonishing record of events and serves as a time capsule of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it fosters a better understanding of how traumatic events affect our fellow human beings. This documentary is a powerful achievement in wartime reporting.",8.0
20 Days in Mariupol,Brent Marchant,"Considering the searing nature of this troubling documentary, I feel somewhat uneasy in recommending it as must-see viewing. Nevertheless, this is one of those films that has to be seen in order for the truth behind its story to be fully realized. When Ukrainian journalist-writer-director Mstyslav Chernov and two colleagues chronicled the first days of the nation’s brutal conflict with Russia, they probably had no idea what they were in for. Working from the Black Sea port city of Mariupol, they captured devastating footage of the relentless Russian attacks, particularly the enemy’s ruthless assaults on civilian targets, despite assurances to the contrary. The Russians were simultaneously determined to destroy the Ukrainian communications infrastructure to prevent word of the atrocities from getting out to the wider world, seriously hindering the work of Chernov and company as the only international journalists still in the war-torn country at the time. As the city was systematically being destroyed, the international community had little knowledge of what was transpiring in Mariupol beyond Russian President Vladimir Putin’s skewed propaganda claims. But, when images of the warfront finally made their way out of Ukraine, the world got an entirely new perspective on the carnage unfolding there, despite the Russians’ astoundingly incredulous claims that everything that had been photographed was staged, not unlike what one would find on a movie set. Such reporting opened the eyes of the world, first in media coverage at the time and now in this film, a joint production of the Associated Press and the PBS documentary series Frontline. This gripping release holds nothing back, making it an exceedingly difficult watch for virtually everyone, including those with thick skins who ordinarily might not be affected by such graphic imagery. However, it honestly reveals what the Ukrainians were up against in this horrific siege, putting the war crimes of the aggressors on display for all to see. In addition, this offering reinforces the importance of the work of intrepid journalists under the most trying of conditions, particularly where those wreaking havoc are desperate to keep the facts from reaching the light of day. This highly acclaimed film – a recipient of ample awards season buzz and honors – may be difficult to sit through, but discovering the truth is often a challenging process, and both Ukraine and the world should be grateful that there are those out there who are willing to put themselves on the line to see that through, no matter how treacherous or daunting circumstances may be.",9.0
20 Days in Mariupol,CinemaSerf,"This is quite an harrowing documentary following a camera crew who secret themselves in a makeshift hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol as the Russian military advances. What starts on day one as a largely intact and functioning urban area is gradually reduced to rubble as the invading forces bombard the place from the ground and the air slowly terrorising the populace and removing their access to even the most basic of necessities - shelter, water, electricity. It's told chronologically, and therefore it's quite easy for us to see the degradation day-by-day as the people somewhat stoically determine to stay put in the face of some pretty overwhelming military might. The fact that many people do stay is remarkably well captured here. Not just those living there, but those in the professional services who stay to tend the sick, put out the fires - their own sort of ""Blitz Spirit"". It's emotionally charged from the start and though there can be no denying it's propagandist nature at times, it still offers us an undeniable video-diary of the indiscriminate destruction of a city where - just like the V1 and V2 rockets - these explosives literally fall out of the sky and land where they may. There is clearly no ""targeting"" going on with the assault. The narration is just a little too softly spoken. Not that it needed Lord Olivier, but it was quite difficult to hear that was being described at times. In the end, I don't suppose that mattered too much for we can easily see what is going on. Ultimately, it also illustrates well the futility of this invasion. Whoever is left in control of this extended bomb site is unlikely to ever be able to make any use of it, or it's facilities, again. It's obliteration for the sake of it - purely as a show of strength intended to intimidate. This is a solid testament to courageous journalism that tugs at the heart strings, arouses anger and sympathy and though never an easy watch is well worth looking at.",7.0

Perfect Blue,The Movie Diorama,"Perfect Blue perfectly blends psychologically disturbed fantasy with grounded reality. Mima Kirigoe. A pop-idol. An actress. An X-rated model. Public image and its personifying echoes circulate around the world, adhering to the desires of endearing fans alike. But when their inspirational idol haphazardly shifts career, from pop sensation to dramatic actress, the psychosis of the modern consumer society ultimately changes with her. Saddened, angered and crazed. Mima’s abrupt persona altering career move may have developed maddened stalkers, including her fantastically imagined past self haunting the newly suppressed version.

The late Satoshi Kon was known for seamlessly blending fantasy with reality. Depicting an opaque blurred line between delusions and actualities. None more so, than in his exaggerated psychologically disturbed work in Perfect Blue. For many the art form of Japanese animation, commonly titled as “anime”, is cited as “childish”. “Anime is for losers” tweeted kickboxer Andrew Tate. Well, if like Mr. Tate you believe anime to be childish, I implore you to watch Perfect Blue. Without illustrating the voyeuristic nature of Murai’s narrative, it is the most accessibly invigorating piece of psychological stimulation, that is strictly aimed towards adults, to ever be constructed from this art form.

The complete metamorphosis of a character that questions her own perceived identity through inquisitional explicit acts of graphic nature. Exploring the psychosis of shared delusional disorder and the acute harassment of an obsessive stalker. Kon establishes a murder mystery whilst inciting the emasculation of a vulnerable female’s world. Male controllers, likened to manipulative deities of authoritative powers, are gradually weakened by a mysterious individual. Culminating into a twistingly fragmented climax that grants Mima the independence that she was repressed from.

Kon’s intelligence in foreshadowing, the drama series ‘Double Bind’ essentially replicating Mima’s regressive state of mind, allows the audience to question several aspects. He smartly manages to maintain the central mystery without deterring from Mima’s mental instability. He doesn’t stop there though. Kon refuses to relinquish thematic presence in every frame. Exploring the fragility of a rape victim and the traumatisation of such an explicitly heightened ordeal. The dangers of online anonymity and the tarnishing of existing careers. Challenging the extremities of art in all its mediums. The realism of Perfect Blue is what forces its story to be so utterly terrifying. It’s not just a psychological thriller. It’s horror.

Kon’s signature animation style is gloriously vibrant as always, with attentive detail towards realistic environments. The grotesque facial features of “Me-Mania”, only possible in this art form, heighten the natural malformed detest we have for him. Ikumi’s audacious score enables the heart to palpitate more frequently with its sharp tones and ethereal voices. And, as rare as this is, the English dub is surprisingly decent.

The reality is that Perfect Blue transcends the medium that it is presented in. It stimulates through Kon’s trademark visceral style, allowing the dangers of early Internet culture to produce a thrilling psychologically adept feature that blurs fantasy with reality. I mean, for a film to make me stand up, clap my hands and utter the words “perfection”, it has to be something special right?. Well, Perfect Blue is special, because it is perfect. And yes, with that said it does indeed garner the perfect rating. Quite possibly the best anime feature to ever be released.",10.0

Like so many other impressionable young folks, she tries to follow her dream - but is really only following his, and is soon being photographed (intimately), denigrated and her grasp on reality is soon compromised. When things start to take an altogether more sinister turn, though, we start to wonder just who is responsible for a series of murders amongst those known to hold disparaging views on the young woman. Might she be developing some form of lethal schizophrenia or is she (and are they) really the victims of an over-zealous fan. At times this is actually quite harrowing. The plundering of her innocence by those both venal and neglectful of this young woman is writ large and is really quite depressing to watch. The story itself deals frankly with the unsavoury nature of not just exploitation, but of the pressures the constant search for success can put on a developing mind. This packs quite a lot to think about in in eighty minutes, and 25 years on is still a potent watch.",7.0
Only the River Flows,Lachlan Thiele,"<b>EXT. WHERE DOES THE RIVER STOP - DAY</b>

<i>Only The River Flows</i> is my first <i>Wei Shujun film</i>, and it is now someone I'd like to explore as I adored many elements of this film. 
First, it's shot on film 😍 which builds a beautiful atmosphere solidified through noir-style lightning and heavy smoking. I'm already on board any time a film noir style is present; <i>Only The River Flows</i> is solid throughout the first 80 minutes of the film, as it's fully engulfed in that crime noir storytelling. A cop hunts down a killer, and when an arrest is made, and the case can be shut, a thought of 'why' lingers on the officer's mind. 

The plot intrigued me as it flowed into a psychological thriller, sometimes reminding me of Twin Peaks, which is a tremendous compliment. However, there is a literal 'BANG' at the minute 80 mark, and the final 20 minutes start going all over the place. I love where the film went during the final moments, involving a 'Twin Peaks' style dream sequence. However, the last act's apparent lack of cohesiveness ultimately disappoints — pulling my review from a solid four stars into a three.

Only the River Flows,CinemaSerf,"""Ma Zhe"" (Zhu Yilong) engenders an almost adulatory degree of support from his team as he leads them on an investigation following the discovery of the body of the goose-rearing ""Granny Four"" on a remote riverside. Suspicion quickly falls on her adopted friend known simply as the ""madman"", but the detective is not so convinced that things are that straightforward. His ensuing task isn't helped by pressure from his ping-pong playing boss to conclude quickly and by the fact that he and his wife are expecting a baby - and that procedure is not going to be as simple as they might like. With the rain pretty much relentless throughout, he encounters some quirky local characters who seem to muddy the waters rather than offer him clarity. Clarity? Well that's an element to this story that is a bit too sparing at times. ""Ma Zhe"" finds his troubles gradually getting the better of him - yes, there are more bodies - and soon his own grasp on reality becomes distinctly compromised. Can he keep it together long enough to solve the crime? The film starts with the usual affirmation of the communist values of team play before entering the realms of predictable cop drama tempered with a bit of undercooked psycho-babble that Zhu Yilong tries to hard hold together. By the denouement, though, I felt way too much of the plot was contrived to try to tap into the psyche - of him and us - and it didn't really work. That said, he does well here and we do get quite a tense sense of his gradually becoming overwhelmed by the scenarios that test his usually linear style of working, thinking and living. Sadly, aside from ""Ma Zhe"", the characters are barely developed and director Wei Shujun seems more interested in focussing on an admittedly gritty and authentic looking peek at 1990s rural China, whilst rather abandoning the detail and characterisation of story to the sidelines as the dream sequences blur more and more the line between reality and fantasy. It does move along well enough, but I found it a bit of a meringue of a film - not much when you get into it.",6.0

""Rose"" (Jessie Buckley) is a fairly foul mouthed single parent who calls a spade a spade and after befriending ""Edith"" initially, seems to have earned her enmity.

I found it pretty easy to guess who the culprit was, but the knowing doesn't really impact on this rather joyous romp through a society of double standards and bigotry. The language is ripe but even when at it's most objectionable, it's always quite funny to think what genuinely might have shocked a generation of bible-bashers and bridge-players. There's quite a fun sub-plot with Dame Eileen Atkins, Joanna Scanlan and Lolly Adefope to help keep the mischief rolling along nicely, the police force are well represented in the haplessness stakes by Hugh Skinner and Paul Chahidi and, oh - of course ""Rose"" has a black boyfriend ""Bill"" (Malachi Kirby) just to further antagonise her less than worldly brethren.

I'm not quite sure what I was expecting here. Clearly the toxic mix of raging male hormones and pretty much unlimited booze creates a fairly hostile environment for the women, but the story sort of plateaus aground a denouement that really disappoints. There's nothing really new here, nor is there anything particularly innovative. It plays rather unkindly to mid-Australian stereotype and sort of fizzles out at the denouement. It had potential, but somehow Kitty Green seemed uncertain as to how to conclude and so we end up with something unremarkable and frankly rather weak.

""Good Luck to You, Leo Grande is a surprisingly enlightening, lovely, amusing story about sex, pleasure, self-acceptance, and genuine human connections. Sophie Hyde is able to create a safe environment where uncomfortable, sensitive topics can be discussed as ordinary conversation.

Emma Thompson and Daryl McCormack share tremendous chemistry, both committing 100% to their roles, but the actress stands out, being a strong contender for awards even beyond the festival.

However, for a film that tackles hard-to-talk-about themes with so little restraint, it feels a bit disappointing that nudity and sex itself are barely depicted in an equally natural, free form.

Despite a redundant mid-portion, it's a must-watch movie with an absolutely perfect last shot.""

"Good Luck to You, Leo Grande",CinemaSerf,"""Nancy"" (Dame Emma Thompson) rents an hotel room and a younger man ""Leo"" (Daryl McCormack) so she can tick off - quite literally - some of the sexual activities that she never experienced during her rather mundane 33-year marriage to the recently deceased ""Robert"". He arrives, she is bowled over, and the next ninety minutes sees them explore the character traits and bodies of the other. It is entertaining. There is a nervousness from this older woman - a former teacher - who wants to experiment with some of the most basic aspects of sex but who cannot stop herself over-thinking, vacillating and using just about every diversionary tactic in the book to avoid actually getting it on with her hunky and charming partner. For his part, ""Leo"" comes across as a decent, sincere employee who is patience personified. Will anything come of it? The narrative is split into four meetings - their first, the nervous; their second more confident but still with plenty of nerves to overcome then the third. That is where the film starts to wobble a bit. A series of scenes that display a conflict that seems to have been artificially created to add drama. It wasn't necessary, and somehow that undermined the concluding meeting which was certainly the most visually raunchy and honest. This is a film that is here for us to enjoy. It does touch on an whole range of issues, but in an almost tangential fashion - there is no pontificating. It suggests we consider the attitudes society has about age, sex, loneliness, fulfilment, sexuality, family, judgemental behaviour, tolerance, friendship, love - you name it. It is probably too simplistic a story to offer any definitive solution to the imponderables of the ""sex industry"" but it does present us with food for thought. There is a chemistry between the two that at times makes you squirm, then laugh, then want to bang their heads together, whilst it addresses taboos that makes little sense when laid bare on a big screen, but which resonate profoundly - if not aways rationally - with the characterisations played before us. Strong and nuanced performances from both, with a cleverly and pithily written script that is well worth an hour and an half.",7.0

"Good Luck to You, Leo Grande",r96sk,"What a terrific film!

If you had told me the general gist of <em>'Good Luck to You, Leo Grande'</em> out of context, I'd have predicted a dull and dreary 90 minutes or so were ahead of me. Thankfully, the film itself is a delight. Before watching, I only knew of the poster and thought it was strictly a sex comedy, so was expecting a silly, fast-paced, if forgettable, age gap romcom.

The film is, thankfully, much more than that. Emma Thompson is just brilliant in her role, while Daryl McCormack is superb from beginning to end - cool to see him in a larger role than in (the awesome) <em>'<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)"">Peaky Blinders</a>'</em>. It's perfect casting, the two absolutely nail their performances and are a joy to watch onscreen together.

The one location (for the most part) doesn't hamper things, if anything it only adds to events. I was particularly impressed with the dialogue, especially the more comedic moments. There is one line involving Rolf Harris which was, perhaps, a misstep but all in all it's pretty sharp. It has a story to tell and one that I think it portrays very nicely.",9.0
Cabrini,CinemaSerf,"Cristiana Dell'Anna delivers strongly here as the eponymous nun determined to set up a network of orphanages in China to help the sick and impoverished children there. Her persistent hassling of the Vatican for permission - and funds - has finally wound them up to the point where she is invited to Rome to be finally told no. Even there, though, she's sticking to her guns and after a persuasive audience with Pope Leo XIII (Giancarlo Giannini) manages to get permission to prove her worth - only in New York! To it's slum and run-down Five Points district she is sent and what now begins is an adventure that tests her very mettle as the, at best indifferent, attitude of the Archbishop (David Morse) is more concerned with appeasing the Mayor (John Lithgow) than facilitating her wishes for profound change. It's curious that in a city founded by immigrants there existed such a polarity of the Italian, the Jewish and Irish communities offering little, if any, tolerance of the other. Cabrini realises that neither her religion nor her status as a nun is going to help her - she is going to have to recruit local urchins and fight for every scrap of progress. It's history, so we do know what ultimately happens but Alejandro Monteverde has produced a classy looking portrait that still imbues enough jeopardy into the proceedings as she struggles. Her single-minded determination, her bloody-mindedness - all tempered with huge amounts of humanity and decency are well portrayed here. This is a very good looking film, and the narrative also demonstrates clearly the diminished role of women in what purported to be an open and democratic society - American and Italian, and a class system that cared little for those who lived on the wrong side of the tracks. It's a bit long - there are moments that slow the pace down and drag the story, but in the main this is a poignant telling of the story of a woman who was prepared to sacrifice whatever was necessary for those less privileged.",7.0
Blue Giant,CinemaSerf,"I very nearly didn't make the 30-mile schlep to my local Cineworld to watch this film but I'm really glad I did. It's not about a whale, no. It's about the aspirational saxophonist ""Dai"" who heads to Tokyo with dreams of taking over the world. He arrives, unannounced, on the doorstep of his friend ""Tamada"" looking for a bed for a few days. Needless to say, that few days turns out to be a bit longer and their friendship starts to strain a bit (the visitor snores!). ""Dai"" visits a small bar and meets the jazz-loving owner ""Akiko"" who sends him to a live venue where he encounters the pianist ""Sawabe"" whom he tries to convince to form a band. They are both eighteen but the latter man has been playing for about fourteen years longer than his new friend, so is a little sceptical! That doesn't last long once he hears him play and they soon decide they need a drummer to keep both from straying into the uncontrollable territory that can be improv jazz! Well, it turns out that his ""landlord"" isn't half bad at beating time with a stick on a Coke can - but can he up his game and turn this duo into a trio good enough to play at the city's most prestigious club - ""So Blue""? The story itself is a bit predicable, with a few temper tantrums, frustrations and fallings out but it does illustrate well just how athletic these musicians must be to perform. Hands are covered in calluses and bruises, the sax takes quite a toll on the breathing and at times it's touch and go as to whether they can make it out of the starting block. There's nothing easy about the task they have set themselves nor the dedication and sacrifices it will take to achieve (or not) their goal. The animation itself it a little hit and miss, the CGI works much less well that the hand drawn scenes, but what really works here is the synchronisation with the musicians and that can be really immersive at times. If you are a fan of this genre of music, then you are in for a treat of Coltrane, Stitt et al. The saxophone (Tomoaki Baba), piano (Hiromi Uehara) and drums (Shun Ishiwaka) are unafraid to start off timidly and (especially the drummer) very rough around the edges, but as the story develops and they improve and become more confident, so do their performances until a tragedy tinged denouement that really does get the toes tapping. I'd have to say - there is no point in watching this is if this style of rambling, meandering and frankly rather musically self-indulgent performance doesn't appeal to you, but the powerful mix of frenetically syncopated animation and music I found really quite compelling. Sure, it's a bit long - but it's well worth a watch.",7.0
The Promised Land,Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/the-promised-land-venice-film-festival-review-mads-mikkelsen-shines-once-again/

""The Promised Land is a profound character study of how personal ambitions and desires inevitably will fail without love, compassion, and everything else that makes us human.

Accompanied by somber cinematography and an atmospheric score, the cast delivers outstanding performances, especially Mads Mikkelsen who utilizes all his experience to drive the story with a magnetic display.

Heavy, predictable, and somewhat repetitive at times, but totally worth the ticket.""

The Promised Land,CinemaSerf,"Mads Mikkelsen is in his element here as the determined pioneer Ludvig Kahlen. He has been a soldier in the Danish army and has now set his heart on cultivating some salty heathland on a barren Jutland. Fortunately for him, King Frederik V is keen to see this land settled and become more productive, so he is encouraged to go and farm there. His arrival ruffles the feathers of local grandee Frederik De Schinkel (Simon Bennebjerg) who considers the land to be his, and who makes it clear that he will make life awkward for his new neighbour. Relations are not helped when he takes in a pair of runaway servants - ""Ann Barbara"" (Amanda Collin) and husband ""Johannes"" (Morten Hee Andersen) and then falls for the man's aristocratic cousin Edel Helene (Kristine Kujath Thorp) to whom De Schinkel wishes to be married - cementing his place amongst a somewhat sceptical nobility. With the pot simmering along nicely now, things start to go missing. There's a pilferer about. Kahlen quickly discovers that it's a young girl who lives with the local Romany population and pretty quickly ""Anmai Mus"" (Melina Hagberg) is an extra mouth for them to feed. De Schinkel isn't averse to some underhand methods to thwart the would-be farmer and so resorts to increasingly violent, cruel, even murderous tactics that make the tasks of staying within the law and of growing potatoes almost impossible - but he doesn't quite appreciate the guile and ingenuity of Kahlen. This is a story of perseverance and determination, it's also a story of love and of acceptance. Indeed, for just about everyone here the goal is to find some roots, a place to call home, a family, maybe even an identity. There evolves a good chemistry between Mikkelsen, Collin and the convincing young Hagberg and Bennebjerg - well he gives the distinct impression that he doesn't come from the deepest of gene pools really quite effectively. It is prone to the odd meander at times, especially as it gets up an head of steam, but once in full flow this is quite a gripping adventure that marries the bleak and the optimistic whilst allowing Mikkelsen to do what he does best. Well worth watch.",7.0
Rally Road Racers,CinemaSerf,"This remind anyone of the ""Tortoise and the Hare""? The rather aptly named ""Vainglorious"" is about to bulldoze the family home where the young ""Zhi"" lives with his grandmother. Now he's not a bad rally driver, but he tends to bottle it when he spies the winning post, so when he challenges his new nemesis to victory in the upcoming, and perilous, ""Silk Road Rally"" - his opponent thinks it's a bit of a no-brainer. ""Zhi"" doesn't even have a car! Well, luckily for the young man he alights on grizzly veteran ""Gnash"" who not only finds him a car, but soups it up for him and agrees to be his (grumpy) co-driver as they embark on a race that would test the mettle of anyone. Needless to say, ""Vainglorious"" has every gadget and gizmo available, and has no scruples about cheating - so the task is very much an uphill one for our dynamic duo. Can he save his home and make sure that it's his foe with egg on his face? It's actually quite a fun little animation, this. It uses the racing as a conduit to introduce us to lots of different characters, to make friends, evaluate priorities and, of course, to ensure the philosophical toast doesn't end up butter side down! It did look quite good on a big screen, the action scenes are fun and the characterisations engaging enough to keep it interesting, if entirely predictable, for ninety minutes. You'll never remember it, but you might enjoy it as brain-freeze fodder. I did.",6.0
Chinatown,John Chard,"He nose you know!

Chinatown is directed by Roman Polanski and written by Robert Towne. It stars Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, John Huston, Perry Lopez and John Hillerman. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by John A. Alonzo.

Private investigator J.J. Gittes (Nicholson) is working on an adultery case but quickly finds himself embroiled in murder and corruption.

The gathering of Polanski, Towne, Nicholson and Robert Evans (producer) put their respective skills together to craft one of the most lauded neo-noir films of all time. It's a searing picture awash with the staples of the film noir and gumshoe detective movies that graced cinema in the 40s and 50s. From the characterisations (suspicious femmes - mouthy coppers - sleazy kingpin - tough protagonist in a whirlpool of unravelling layers), to the hard boiled script, violence, sex and brutal revelations, it's a noir essential that only lacks chiaroscuro and expressionistic swirls to seal the complete deal.

Allegoraries unbound, iconography assured and dialogue now in the lexicon of legends, Chinatown is not to be missed, not just by fans of noir, but fans of cinema, period. 9.5/10",9.5
Chinatown,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**Great.**

I can't say much about Roman Polanski because I feel I've seen too little of his work to make a more global analysis: I have only seen _The Ninth Gate_, _The Pianist_ and, now, this film. It's not much… but the truth is that they are three films that I really liked, and about which I have a very good opinion. This film is very good, fitting into a style that we can call “neo-noir”, insofar as its visual aesthetic is heavily inspired by noir, with the caveats that are due, as it is a color film and not black and white. Polanski is an attentive and meticulous director, who provides the audience with quality work, in which every detail has been thought of.

With a story set in San Francisco during the 1930s, the film is very similar to the gangster movies that came out in the 40's and 50's. The story revolves around a private detective, an ex-cop, who is hired to watch a man in what appears to be just another case of adultery. Everything changes when he discovers that the woman who hired him is not a jealous wife. The search for answers will lead him to a web of intrigue and crimes that involves an important Californian company and a public works contract that can be decisive for the city's water storage. It's an excellent story, capable of holding us in the first few minutes and that harmoniously combines tension, romance and suspense, in the right measures.

In addition to an excellent story, with a very well written script, the film presents us with a high quality cast headed by Jack Nicholson, at a time when he was still young and elegant enough to play heartthrob roles. The actor is very good and leaves in this film one of the most interesting works of his career. Faye Dunaway is not far behind and is simply wonderful, dignified and elegantly seductive, as a “femme fatale” should be. John Huston (Nicholson's father-in-law in real life, at this time) also appears in the film and makes a very positive and interesting participation.

In addition to these qualities, the film also has superb production values: impeccably shot, with great angles and sharpness, it has very good cinematography, beautiful colors and light and shadow effects, in addition to excellent sepia tones that are called reinforcing the dominant ""vintage"" ambience. The film was a very detailed production, in which special attention was given to the creation of the sets and the choice of filming locations, so that everything fit well into the historical period. The choice of cars (which are important in the course of the plot) and the design of the costumes and props was also very careful. Last but not least, a note of praise for the excellent soundtrack, which was conceived by Jerry Goldsmith.",10.0
Chinatown,CinemaSerf,"I think this might be my favourite role from Faye Dunaway. She is ""Evelyn"", a woman who suspects that her husband ""Hollis"" (Darrell Zwerling) is playing away from home. She engages the services of the cynical PI ""Gittes"" (Jack Nicholson) and pretty soon people are dead and he is embroiled in an internecine story of adultery, corruption and manipulation that proves pretty perilous for a detective who is working with one women he suspects is being a bit frugal with the truth and another whose identity he is desperately struggling to discover. Nicholson is also on super form, his performance is natural and engaging with a solid chemistry between his and Dunaway adding a richness to this rather quirky plot. Roman Polanski has assembled a strong supporting cast - notably John Huston who features sparingly but effectively as her wealthy, untrustworthy, father ""Noah"" and the photography does a great deal to help generate a sense of accumulating intrigue as we gradually make some headway through this complicated and interesting character study. The production looks great - the 1930s costume and motor cars alongside a smattering of the simmering attitudes that prevailed at the time are encapsulated well too. It's a shade over two hours, but it hits the ground running and never really stops until the ending that though not entirely unexpected, still has enough elements of surprise to keep it compelling.",7.0
The Three Musketeers: Milady,CinemaSerf,"I can't say that I enjoyed this as much as the first outing for this new breed of musketeers, but it's still an enjoyable and authentic looking adaptation of these timeless and honourable Dumas characters. We know that ""Constance"" (Lyna Khoudri) has been kidnapped and that the enamoured ""D'Artagnan"" (François Civil) is determined to get her back - but how? Well the almost fatal attack on the king (Louis Garrel) has galvanised everyone - friend and foe, and the musketeers determine that they must get to the ringleader of that plot before it is eventually accomplished and the kingdom is plunged into chaotic warfare. Now everyone suspects the malevolent Cardinal Richelieu (Eric Ruf) but surely it's not in his interests to kill Louis XIII? The Queen (Vicky Krieps) and her not-so-secret English lover Buckingham (Jacob Fortune-Lloyd) might be in the mix, or maybe just a disgruntled nobleman? ""D'Artagnan"" is first with a clue after he inadvertently rescues ""Milady"" (Eva Green) from a prison (after she fell off a cliff!) armed with a secret, coded letter. What does it mean? Can it help find his love and save the kingdom? Meantime, we start to learn a little more about this enigmatic ""MIlady"" and of her relationship with ""Athos"" (Vincent Cassel) whilst his two pals ""Aramis"" (Romain Duris) and the affable ""Porthos"" (Pio Marmaï) do their bit for the story and the country too. It looks great - the settings, the costumes, the combat scenes all smack of effort having been spent on making the scenarios ring true. I'm still no great fan of Eva Green, but here she starts to exude just the tiniest hint of menace as the story builds to the conclusion of this search for love and traitors. It's a wee bit more earnest, this time around - there's less humour and I missed that. I don't mean laugh out loud stuff, but here we rarely see all the musketeers together; their camaraderie isn't so obvious. This is essentially Civil v Green and that doesn't always work so well. Still, it's a solid and quickly paced adventure story that I found passed two hours effortlessly.",7.0

""Stopmotion stands out as an unforgettable, challenging film, intertwining the art of stop-motion animation with the depth of psychological horror in a narrative as complex as it is disturbing. Although its dense story and unconventional approach are elements distant from the tastes of the general audience, it's a testament to creative power and the exploration of meaningful themes.

The disgusting makeup and repugnant practical effects combined with an equally unsettling sound design, as well as the intriguing study of an artist's obsession and the search for validation, create a truly memorable cinematic experience.

The Teachers' Lounge,Brent Marchant,"In recent years, we’ve all seen examples of incidents that start out comparatively small but that quickly get blown all out of proportion – and unreasonably so at that. As developments emerge and explode under these conditions, they often lose all sense of rationality and soon take on lives of their own, expanding into tangential and seemingly unrelated areas that have virtually nothing to do with the event that spawned them. And, in the end, we’re left with outcomes that seem inappropriate and ill-suited to what launched these insane scenarios in the fist place. That’s what writer-director Ilker Çatak explores in his latest offering, a dramatic satire about what unexpectedly grows out of a case of petty theft in the teachers’ lounge at a German middle school. Before long, the victim in this incident (Leonie Benesch) becomes swept up in a very public dust-up that leads to her becoming a very public pariah in the eyes of her peers, her students and their parents, while those in official capacities sit on the sidelines and do virtually nothing to address the issue. The situation thus serves as a microcosmic metaphor for what’s happening on a wider scale in society at large today, drawing in such ancillary elements as racial and national prejudice, the incendiary role of the media, the impact of unsubstantiated innuendo, the protection of personal privacy, the indulgence of contemporary youth, and the sway of fake news in shaping public opinion, a rather full plate of dubious and unsavory fallout stemming from comparatively meager beginnings. While some may contend that these outcomes are somewhat exaggerated in nature, they nevertheless collectively draw attention to undeniably troubling issues desperately in need of attention in our increasingly out-of-control world, global concerns that obviously transcend national borders, all punctuated here with more than a few hefty infusions of wickedly absurdist humor. “The Teachers’ Lounge” might not appeal to everyone, but, for those who enjoy films that aren’t afraid to present biting social commentary, this should be added to your watch list. As the picture so sadly shows, even supposedly civil environments aren’t immune from the kind of social nonsense depicted here, a troubling teaching for all of us who are looking for a return to sanity in an increasingly crazy existence.",8.0
The Teachers' Lounge,BornKnight,"German drama film directed by İlker Çatak, and that is nominated for best international movie for the 96th Academy Awards.

Leonie Benesch as Carla Nowak, and idealist Polish immigrant teacher have a suspicion of theft at her 1st grade school raised by one of the student towards another (immigrant Turk) student.

After this incident and the reunion with the father of the boys she withstands another small theft at the teacher lounge, and after that she decides to mount a trap to confirm her suspicions putting her coat with the wallet and some money and laptop to film. The money is stolen but only the sleeve of the robber is seen - the sleeve with a unique painting that another functionary on the teacher lounge uses, and she aboard her (that is mother of another immigrant student).

From this pretext the movie delves into a suspicion web mixed with xenophobia and student pro and against the late case boy that divide opinions and breaks the fragile peace that the school once had, including with some more radical students that oppose order and make false statements.  

The movie is engaging and the web of suspense got me till the end, and it is a nice entry to best international movie. I would rate it a 8.0 out of 10 / A - as a whole.",8.0
The Teachers' Lounge,CinemaSerf,"There's a spate of petty thefts going on in her junior school, so after a rather dubiously executed class search fails to deliver a culprit, the enthusiastic and maybe a little naive teacher ""Miss Novak"" (Leonie Benesch) sets a video trap to see if she can identify the culprit. She does, potentially, identify someone going through her pockets and headmaster ""Böhm"" (Anne-Katrin Gummich) now tries to deal with a scenario that rapidly spirals out of control and reveals an increasing degree of toxicity for not just this teacher, but for relationships at all levels throughout the school - as well as a fairly counter-productive environment of red-tape. We are soon facing a stand-off situation that borders on the criminal with some surprisingly potent battle lines soon drawn both inside and outside of the teacher's lounge. I had credibility issues with what happens now. It's not that the drama isn't well acted and tautly directed, indeed the young Leonard Stettnisch's portrayal of her student-cum-antagonist ""Oskar"" is really effective. It is just that too much of what occurs struck me as preposterous. Any procedures in place to protect teachers and pupils seems to gave been chucked under the dramatic bus and the absence of police or qualified investigative authorities here just didn't ring true as we made our way to a denouement that I felt rather underwhelmed. It's gripping, and well worth a watch - but plausible? Hmmm, I'm not so sure.",6.0

Dumb Money,CinemaSerf,"To be perfectly honest, I have never quite understood how you could make money buying stock in a company that you actually wanted to go bust! I watched this and I'm still not really any the wiser. It all centres around the internet influencer Keith Gill (Paul Dano) who quite fancied the undervalued stock in a video game store called ""GameStop"". He started to suggest to his followers that this was a decent buy - despite the fairly obvious fact that the venture capitalists were selling the company short with a view to it collapsing. Slowly but surely the word spreads and the stock starts to rise. What now ensues is a worm that turns story as the gazillionaires at their polo clubs find these gadfly small investors really are becoming a fly in their vichyssoise. Can the little guy prevail? This is quite an enjoyably paced drama with it's roots in reality but for me, the acting was really lacklustre and it drew a really simplistically linear distinction between the have and the have nots that didn't really intrigue my brain. It certainly demonstrates the power of the internet and that galvanising the population can easily buck some established business practices but somehow I didn't especially admire the little guys here either - they were to varying degrees just as aspirational, wanted what the rich guys had and didn't much care how they got it!

""Sometimes I Think About Dying tackles social anxiety and loneliness in a purposefully dull yet intriguing fashion. Lingering cinematography, atmospheric score, and a phenomenal Daisy Ridley somehow make it all work, but its uneventful, repetitive narrative won't be for everyone.""

Rating: B-",6.0
Sometimes I Think About Dying,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**

I really love “Sometimes I Think About Dying,” director Rachel Lambert‘s low-key, melancholy character piece about a socially awkward woman who has an unmet desire for human connection. The unhurried pacing and measured storytelling may be challenging for some viewers, but this little film that seems to be about nothing is actually rooted in depth and has a keen understanding of what it feels like to suffer with crippling social awkwardness.

Living in a small coastal town on the dreary Oregon coast, Fran (Daisy Ridley) spends much of her time alone and often daydreams about dying. She works at a drab office and quietly observes her more outgoing coworkers as they chat with each other and go about their daily routines. She describes herself as “not very interesting,” is quiet and reserved, isn’t very sociable, has no friends, and mostly keeps to herself. This shyness is often mistaken for aloofness, and most everyone steers clear of any interactions with her. Things change when the friendly and slightly awkward Robert (Dave Merheje) starts a job at the company, and he takes an interest in Fran. She’s afraid to give friendship a chance, but there’s something different about him that may just make Robert the first person whom she allows to really get to know her.

There isn’t a whole lot of plot, but Lambert manages to keep her film compelling. Her storytelling style is highly detailed, which gives a warmth to the bleak tone. Nothing feels forced. Lambert paints a dreary portrait of humanity, but does so with wit, style, charm, and humor. There’s so much subtlety in what’s left unspoken, and the film shows us Fran’s professional and personal life, but never tells us what to feel.

The film is well cast from top to bottom, including Parvesh Cheena, Marcia DeBonis, and Megan Stalter, who add a lot of amusement as Fran’s office mates, and Merheje and Ridley feel charmingly authentic. Right down to her body language, from avoiding eye contact to a slouched posture when her character is feeling uncomfortable, Ridley wholly embodies what it must feel like to be Fran. It’s a skilled, effective performance, and one with few spoken words.

It may sound like a hard sell to sit through a movie that’s focused on a lead character who suffers from severe social anxiety, but “Sometimes I Think About Dying” is a good, simple story that’s told well. It’s a captivating film that gracefully expresses the need for human connection while being unable to rid yourself of debilitating melancholia.",8.0

Cats in the Museum,CinemaSerf,"""Vinsent"" is a ginger cat who finds himself stranded on an island populated only by a rather savage, but dumb, dog and by a mouse. They inhabit a grand old mansion house where their daily routine is quite literally that - routine! Anyway, a storm comes along and this causes their home to crumble into the sea leaving the cat and his mouse friend ""Moris"" floating the seas inside a piano! Luckily, that's picked up by a tanker and next thing, they are in the world renowned Hermitage museum in St Petersburg and 'Vinsent"" is dragooned into a herd of other cats whose mission is to protect the priceless artwork. Needless to say, ""Moris"" finds his life now somewhat more perilous - especially as he has a penchant for dining on the fabric of fine art. The ""Mona Lisa"" is coming to visit and so everyone is on alert, security is heightened - bit still, it gets stolen. All fingers point to the mouse, but is there something more sinister going on that ""Vinsent"" can get to the bottom of? The animation here is all pretty basic, but it's still quite an enjoyably daft adventure with plenty going on, a few red herrings and just a little romance with the glamorous - if slightly curiously animated - ""Kleopatra"" before a denouement that I can think of plenty of ""art"" I'd want to volunteer for.

The Taste of Things,CinemaSerf,"""Dodin"" (Benoît Magimel) and ""Eugénie"" (Juliette Binoche) have a synergy in the kitchen that creates mouthwatering and innovative culinary treats for their friends. She does the cooking, he more the design; she shuns the limelight, he is more gregarious - but it's a professional relationship that has worked well for the last two decades. It's probably fair to say that they are both a bit slow off the mark, but gradually now their relationship begins to become one of a more personal, intimate, nature but she is still uncertain. How to win her round? Well he starts to prepare delicacies to tempt both her palate and her heart. The path of truth love never runs smooth, though, and soon their dynamic is facing a testing time that will likely see unwelcome change for all concerned. What I actually liked about this film is that there's not a great deal of dialogue. It looks great and the two actors genuinely convince as they prepare their gourmet dishes using ingredients and techniques that are way more fascinating than the unfolding drama between their characters. You can almost smell the food! It also doesn't shy away from some of the culinary curiosities of rustic French cuisine, so be prepared for a few dishes that might not do for your appetite what they do for those on screen, but by two hours in I found myself genuinely invested in what I was watching - and very glad I'd eaten first.

Monty Python and the Holy Grail,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**One of the pinnacles of British humor.**

This was my first contact with Monty Python, which I already knew famously, and I loved the movie. It is quite simply one of the high points of British humor. The film is easy enough to understand, parodying the Arthurian legends surrounding the quest for the Grail, but the story is just a pretext for successive jokes, each one better than the last.

I don't know the group of comedians very well, but I do know a number of great British comedy actors here, starting with John Clease, Terry Jones, Graham Chapman, Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin and Eric Idle. They are very good individually, but priceless together.

The film has several moments worth mentioning, starting perhaps with the witch trial, and then moving on to the fight with the black knight or the knights who say Ni. It's not a very long film, but it's really worth seeing every comic situation. The dialogues are full of hilarious moments. The ending, however, is a little less strong than expected, which does not take away from the film any of its merit.

Technically, it's not a remarkable film. There is no concern here with historical accuracy or rigorous recreation of the Middle Ages, nor does the film ask for it. We have stage costumes and props, obviously fake but functional, and interesting sets, in castles and in some reasonably well chosen places. There are some special effects and visuals, but they aren't notable. Be that as it may, it's a comedy that remains fresh despite the decades that have passed since its debut.",10.0
Monty Python and the Holy Grail,drystyx,"Seriously, you could die laughing from this film.
I remember the first time I watched this film, back in antenna days on the educational UHF station that was all fuzz, and even then I thought I would die laughing.
The story of King Arthur always did beg for such a satire.
The bits are almost all memorable. I durst not mention even one, because I would be tempted to mention a hundred more scenes and a thousand more lines.
This is very slapstick. I never thought I would laugh at cruelty, but when it is obviously so overdone that it can't be taken seriously, like a man having his arms and legs cut off and still thinking he's invincible, especially when the delivery is so perfect, I can't stop laughing. 
There are some people who don't like this film, but those people are wipers of other people's bottoms.",10.0
Monty Python and the Holy Grail,CinemaSerf,"Fortunately for me this was a rather short visit to the surreal land of Monty Python, and though it does have it's moments, I was really quite unimpressed by their Arthurian antics. We start with Graham Chapman's King Arthur gadding about England tying to recruit some suitably worthy individuals to sit at his round table. Task complete, he gets a sign from God that they must undertake the most holy of quests - and find the Cup of Christ. It now falls to the other three - Cleese, Idle and Gilliam - to dress up in suits of armour and seek the grail amongst the innuendo-ridden kingdom. Along the way they encounter the Black Knight, a castle full of sex-starved maidens, some monks - indeed just about everyone you might expect from mediaeval society before a really annoying denouement with the ""Knights of Ni"" - all they want is a little garden, or two... All but fifty years on, it's probably not really fair to look at this with 2024 eyes, but this was my first time of seeing it and I was really left thinking - why didn't the police get involved earlier? It's not that the jokes don't work, well not all of them, anyway - it's that they so labour the punchline. It's as if someone took a thirty minute sketch show and decided to pad it out for an extra hour. Less could certainly have been more. There are a few fun cameos - Carol Cleveland's ""Zoot"" and Connie Booth's witch stand out, but otherwise I felt a bit like I was the victim of some very dated hype. I didn't hate it, but really - what was all the fuss about?",6.0
Quicksand,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"The premise of director Andres Beltran‘s “Quicksand” is the stuff of nightmares. This survivalist suspense thriller follows an estranged American couple (Carolina Gaitan, Allan Hawco) who, on the brink of divorce, travel to Bogotá, Colombia for a work conference. With a little downtime, they decide to take a hike in the rainforest despite the warnings of locals. A surprise storm causes them to become trapped in a pit of quicksand underneath the dense jungle canopy. Unable to move, their situation goes from bad to worse as they are paid a visit from a resident venomous snake.

It’s a simple story that’s terrifying to think about, and the film does a good job at setting up the narrative with a drama-heavy opening half hour. This isn’t an action packed film by any means, but more of a slow burn relationship drama with the added stressor of being stranded in quicksand with limited means of avoiding a deadly snake. The story is well thought out, and Hawco and Gaitan give solid enough performances that make you believe their situation is dire.

This isn’t a bad movie, but it does have its share of problems. The cinematography is dark and murky, which isn’t pleasurable to watch. It fits the bleak jungle setting, but there’s only so much viewers can enjoy about a drab palate of deep browns and drab grays. Some of the scenes are so dark that it’s difficult to see the action. The ending is excessively drawn out too, and there’s no real payoff. Although overall this is an disappointing film, it gets a lot of things right.

Low budget thrillers belong to a genre that often doesn’t require particularly strong direction, acting, or a massive amount of financial backing to make an effective movie, and that’s exactly what “Quicksand” is: a passable movie with a killer story that’s simply not good enough.",4.0
Passages,Brent Marchant,"Intimacy can be a beautiful thing. However, it can also become something messy, hurtful and emotionally devastating when tainted by self-serving agendas, irresponsible intentions, or reckless, short-sighted experimentation, influences that can purposely or unwittingly end up wreaking widespread havoc. Such is the case in writer-director Ira Sachs’s new domestic drama about a flamboyant, free-spirited gay male filmmaker, Tomas (Franz Rogowski), who impulsively jumps into an impromptu fling with a woman, Agathe (Adèle Exarchopoulos), a relationship that leaves his longtime husband, Martin (Ben Whishaw), unsure of what the couple’s future might hold. As time passes, circumstances grow increasingly complicated as each member of this unlikely trio tries to sort out what lies ahead, particularly with the emergence of Tomas’s ever-growing thoughtless capriciousness. Some viewers may look upon the story’s shockingly reprehensible developments as improbable and appalling, but, sadly, as anyone who has ever watched tabloid TV can probably attest, the events depicted here might not appear as far-fetched as one might think. In that respect, this offering presents a bold, courageous, honest look at what can go awry in situations like this, an account loaded with incensed outrage, unbridled ire, biting humor and more than a little cynicism. It’s a narrative that some audience members may find offensive, even deplorable, but, like a horrific car accident, it’s also something that many viewers might find difficult to look away from, thanks in large part to the wholly convincing performances of the three protagonists. Sensitive viewers should be aware that the film includes a fair amount of explicit and provocative sexual content, so those easily offended by such material may not want to put this one on their watch lists. However, for those who appreciate domestic dramas that hold nothing back and that aren’t afraid to get down and dirty in their portrayals of what can happen, this release is about as good as any out there. Just be prepared to be left with your jaw agape – and your head spinning.",7.0
Passages,CinemaSerf,"""Tomas"" (Franz Rogowski) and husband ""Martin"" (Ben Whishaw) find their marriage severley tested when the former man starts to fall for ""Agathe"" (Adèle Exarchopoulos) and that passion drives ""Martin"" into the arms of ""Amad"" (Erwan Kepoa Falé). What now ensues is, frankly, a rather dull introspective of characters that didn't really leap off the screen at me. Rogowski can be a charismatic actor, but here he offers us a rather unremarkable characterisation of a horny man who wants to have his cake and eat it. Whishaw is, routinely these days on screen, just a bit weedy and presents another weakly constructed individual who seems content not to fight for the man he's supposed to love. It's all just rolls along without really catching fire, it's over-scripted and though it may well have a visual authenticity to it, it's all just a bit so what? The production and pacing all contribute to the general ennui of the whole thing and to be honest, I was just a bit disappointed with this rather lacklustre enterprise. I saw it at the cinema this week, but I suspect even the most ardent fans of these three can wait for a television screening.",6.0
What's Love Got to Do with It?,CinemaSerf,"If you remember ""Last Christmas"" (2019) then you will have a rough idea of what to expect here with this rather formulaic, if colourful, drama. It all centres around a film being made by ""Zoe"" (Lily James) about the forthcoming ""assisted"" marriage of her lifelong friend ""Kaz"" (Shazad Latif). Her mother ""Cath"" (Dame Emma Thompson) lives next door to his family and so is relishing the family trip to Pakistan for the traditional wedding. ""Zoe"" is (as, I suspect, are we) pretty sceptical of the whole arrangement - getting married to someone you've only met on Skype, but proceed we do through a lively ceremony that allows Dame Emma to don her sari and dance for all she is worth (gin-fuelled!) whilst the predictable love triangle melodrama slowly, but predictably, plays out. It all comes to an head when they have returned home and she shows her film to all concerned and, just like this, it receives mixed and divisive reviews. I found this all very twee, middle class and vaguely judgmental which after a while I felt rather defeated the purpose in the first place. It is pretty clear from the start what is going to happen, and although the route to that conclusion isn't exactly a straight line, this leaves very little room for jeopardy to a plot you can see from Mars. Latif has a degree of charm to him, and some of the scenes with Lily James are quite engaging in a cheesy sort of way, but for the most part this is eminently forgettable fayre that will do fine on telly at Christmas.",6.0
What's Love Got to Do with It?,r96sk,"Largely underwhelming, even if <em>'What’s Love Got to Do with It?'</em> holds a few redeeming qualities.

It's all competently shot and all that, the music for example is excellent - nice work, Nitin Sawhney & Co. The level of acting is also all good, though I wouldn't say there is necessarily anyone that stands out individually. On that note, Emma Thompson: As usual I like her, but her character isn't the best - I feel like I've seen her play the same (similar, at best) character one or two times before recently-ish, <em>'Last Christmas'</em> for example. She's merits more to work with.

The story is one that is almost as old as time, like with the aforementioned I feel like I've seen this plot play out many a time. It has a couple of unique elements I guess, but overall it's pretty derivative. I'm also not sold on Lily James' Zoe being 'Player 1', so to speak... like, her character is fairly meh.

In fact, I'd go as far to say that Mariam Haque's Jamila should've been the film's key - that part of the story interested me the most of anything else portrayed onscreen. Haque and Michael Marcus's portion only features relatively smally, so I kinda wish they used them two instead as their bits are the most touching.

All in all, it's fine - but is too mundane and predictable to be definitively enjoyable, in my opinion of course.",6.0
Strange Way of Life,Lachlan Thiele,"<b>EXT. STRANGE INDEED - DAY</b>

Indeed a film worth seeing. Don't take it seriously, as at its core; it's just a lot of fun. I can see Pedro and Ethan having the time of their lives with this short. Think of this film as a more campy Brokeback, where the humour grows on you, like our protagonist's budding love.

""Silva"" (Pedro Pascal) rides half way across the desert to meet up with his old pal ""Jake"" (Ethan Hawke) who is the local sheriff. It's pretty clear from the get-go that there is a degree of personal baggage between the pair and that the true purpose of the visit is more than to relight old candles and have a good old reminisce... It's OK, this - nothing more. A testament to the drawing power of Almodóvar and Ethan Hawke to watch what is essentially a non-story that tells a little by way of flashback but for the most part just shows us a glimpse of something not especially interesting or unique. Looks good enough but I left a little disappointed and certainly underwhelmed.",6.0
Carol,Reno,"> Just when it can't get any better...

The first thing I noticed was after seeing the movie is there's some kind of mistake in the Oscars nominee. Rooney Mara should have been on the lead role list, while Cate Blanchett in the supporting character's. Maybe the Academy people misunderstood that the title role must be the lead character. Theirs switched place actually does not make any sense. Anyway the Oscars never made sense at all.

This story was okay, but adapted screenplay and direction, especially the music was excellent. For the ending scene alone, you will be tempted to raise your rating than what you initially thought it deserves. I was not expecting the movie to be awesome, so I'm not upset for the overall movie.

Believe me, the last thing I want in this movie is to see Cate Blanchett in naked. Maybe out of respect or her age or she's not attracted to me, there are plenty of reasons that I can't figure it out which one, but after knowing what this theme is, I was only praying for that not to happen. And obviously that is unavoidable, otherwise the movie will lose its soul and strength.

Well, it was better than I thought, both the actresses were good, but Rooney Mara dominated. Whatever category she's in for the Oscars, I'll be happy if she wins. It is not a must watch, but a decent movie and betters in some parts.

Problemista,Brent Marchant,"Isn’t it amazing how failures can often lead to unexpected successes? Those missteps frequently have a way of opening meaningful doors, even if it doesn’t seem that way at the time they occur. But how readily are we aware that such developments can occur? Such is the whirlwind experience of Alejandro Martinez (Julio Torres), a young, idealistic, inventive Salvadoran toy designer who emigrates to New York in search of a job in an incubator program at a major American toy manufacturer. But, to apply for the position, he must be present stateside, which means he needs a work visa to reside here long enough to make his pitch. That possibility seems to evaporate, though, when he loses his job as a client curator at a cryogenics company. Fortunately, however, as he’s making his exit from the workplace, he meets and befriends a flamboyant art critic (Tilda Swinton) upset with the way the cryogenics company is handling the care of her late partner (RZA), an eccentric artist known for specializing in paintings of eggs. To raise funds for the painter’s curation, she wants to stage an exhibition of his work but needs help to pull it off, which is where Alejandro enters the picture. He volunteers to assist with staging the show in exchange for her sponsorship so that he can obtain a new work visa to stay in the US. It sounds like a simple, straightforward arrangement, but, as he soon finds out, that’s far from the case, as he launches into a wild and crazy odyssey filled with any number of outlandish personal and professional incidents, many of them ludicrous and comical yet surprisingly beneficial. This debut feature from actor-writer-director Torres tells an unconventional yet hilarious and insightful story of commitment, empowerment and imagination filled with colorful characters and enigmatic situations. Its clever production design, imaginative cinematography, and inclusion of surreal and symbolic sequences makes for an edgy yet entertaining watch, an impressive first offering from the former Saturday Night Live staff writer. While there are some instances where the narrative tends to become a little too outrageously self-satisfied for its own good, the bulk of the film stays on course and features an array of fine performances from Torres, Swinton and a host of supporting players. “Problemista” was originally scheduled for release in summer 2023 but was delayed by the SAG-AFTRA strike. However, as this delightfully quirky offering shows, the wait was indeed worth it, as it often is for those who encounter seemingly endless snafus on the way to achieving their greatness. If you’re fond of the irreverent, as I am, you’ll get a kick out of this one, an engaging tale that both enlightens and entertains while giving your mind a lot to play with.",7.0
The Childe,Chris Sawin,"Ultimately, _The Childe_ continues the South Korean trend of refreshing character driven thrillers that are on completely different levels than the typical Hollywood film.

La Chimera,Brent Marchant,"When an English tomb raider (Josh O’Connor) skilled at dowsing uses his skills to hunt down buried Etruscan artifacts, he achieves success at his craft but suffers setbacks when he falls in with the wrong crowd. As a consequence, he drifts through life, trying to find his way (and, ironically enough, a moral footing), an odyssey filled with quirky people and events, a would-be romantic interest (Carol Duarte) with two carefully concealed children, an aging operatic instructor (Isabella Rossellini) skilled at fleecing her “students,” and, of course, his coterie of comical criminal cronies. Writer-director Alice Rohrwacher’s latest tells a delightful fable full of wit, whimsy, colorful characters, high intrigue and its share of surreal moments, all set against the Italian landscape. The film admittedly takes a little time to find its stride, so getting through the opening act will require some patience (editing here would have helped). But, once the picture finds its way, it becomes a fun-filled ride, peppered with absurdist humor and filmed with Fellini-esque cinematography and a production design reminiscent of the famed auteur. With a runtime of 2:10:00, it could stand some trimming (most notably at the outset, as noted above), but this cinematic charmer is a modestly pleasant diversion to watch while stretched out on the couch while casually savoring a demitasse of espresso and a plate of biscotti.

La Chimera,CinemaSerf,"A rather scruffy looking Josh O'Connor is ""Arthur"" who has found a way to make a living in rural Italy where he uses his unique gift with a divining rod - well a big twig, really - to uncover ancient artefacts from deep beneath the surface. He's not averse to a bit of grave robbing either - for which he has recently been imprisoned, and now he and his cohorts sell their stuff to ""Spartaco"" (Alba Rohrwacher) and via a rather unique technique, too! What's clear is that ""Arthur"" is getting over something fairly monumental in his life, and we get a clue to that when he visits the rather doting but blissfully ignorant and elderly ""Flora"" (Isabella Rossellini) at her increasingly dilapidated mansion house where the furniture is destined for the furnace and her family all know the secret, but dare not speak it. He, himself, inhabits a shanty-town style shed abutting the old city wall, his once proud linen suit now grubby and filthy and he is rarely without a cigarette. As the plot unfolds - aided by an agreeably sparing amount of dialogue - we start to get a sense that ""Arthur"" is actually coming to his senses after something akin to a concussion. The pieces of his life are slowly coming together again as he and his pals make the discovery of a lifetime, only for... It's a slowly paced film, but that works well - as do the infrequent but quite punchy comedic elements of the drama. There can be a comparison drawn between the gradual unearthing of the long lost relics and with his own re-realisation but it's all delivered with a brightness that keeps it from becoming downbeat or depressing. Director Alice Rohrwacher offers us a personal story tempered with a bit of mythology and a fair degree of ill-defined humanity that is compellingly incomplete in many ways.

Reality,CinemaSerf,"I didn't know anything about this case before I saw the film, so when I saw ""Reality Winner"" and FBI - well, I was expecting a sort of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" type scenario.

She arrives home one day to find ""Garrick"" (Josh Hamilton) and ""Taylor"" (Marchánt Davis) parked on her lawn with a warrant to search her, her home, her car... She's bemused and a bit nonplussed, especially as her visitors seem way more concerned about the wellbeing of her cat and her dog! Anyway, into the house they eventually go and the interrogation begins. For a while, there is quite an effective intensity to that process and using, as it does, the original transcript of the interview as it happened, it delivers an authentic looking presentation of just how effective these agents can be. It's history, so there's no jeopardy - and I think Sweeney turns in quite a strong performance as the plot thickens but it all takes far too long to get going and the production is all just a bit too staccato. The thread does go some way to revealing the intimidatory powers of Uncle Sam when he feels aggrieved and that makes for uncomfortable watching at times. It isn't an especially memorable drama, and it doesn't need a cinema - but it will be fine to watch on the television  whilst posing a few questions about what is or is not in the ""public interest"".",6.0

Godland,CinemaSerf,"Fr. Lucas (Elliott Crosset Hove) is despatched by his bishop to a remote settlement in Iceland where he is charged with building a church and establishing a parish. Upon arrival, he is met by ""Ragnar"" (Ingvar Sigurdsson) - a rather unwelcoming man, who is tasked with guiding him to the hamlet many days trek away. Their journey tests the mettle of the young priest. The hostility of the environment, the indifference of his travelling companions, the cold, the wind, the rain - all of these make him consider seriously what he is doing and whether he actually has the faith. His exhaustion causes him to finally fall from his horse and upon wakening we discover that he has luckily arrived at his destination and is being nursed by ""Anna"" (Vic Carmen Sonne). He is broadly welcomed and the construction of his church proceeds but he is not a man at ease with his surroundings, his new-found parishioners and but for an increasingly close relationship with ""Anna"" would be an inch from despair. Is this a place where he can settle and live? The cinematography is gorgeous - make sure you take a jumper when you watch it. The sheer inhospitableness of this island. It was hardly a place for the indigenous ponies, it is certainly not a place for a clergyman used to home comforts now reduced to sleeping in a thin canvas tent! He was a photographer - and the film is inspired by a small collection of his photographs that were found. it was possibly this photography that he felt gave him a purpose as the man we see at the end bears little resemblance to the one we meet in Denmark at the beginning. This features a very strong performance from Hove. He manages the transformation of his character well and that encourages us to feel invested in him and his conflict. I did not enjoy, nor really understand, the last fifteen minutes. The story takes a turn for the brutal and the tragic in a way that seemed to me unnecessary and somewhat inexplicable.

Godland,Brent Marchant,"What is God? Is it a reasoned, rational civilized entity or a wild, untamed force full of untamed power in search of being reined in? And, in light of that, then, what kind of relationship are we supposed to have with this elusive divine enigma? That’s one of many unexpected challenges put to a young Lutheran priest (Elliott Crosset Hove) who’s charged with building a church in a small community of Danish immigrants transplanted from the homeland in late 19th Century Iceland, the so-called “unforgiving island.” But, rather than sail directly to his new future home, he chooses to land on the island’s southeastern coast and cross the diverse terrain to his destination, partly to get to know the land and its people but also to indulge his hobby as a pioneering photographer. Once there, however, he gets more than he bargained for, given the difficulty of the journey and the many extreme differences in language, sensibilities and rugged lifestyle compared to the more genteel Denmark he left behind. This combination of elements tests his wits, his patience, and, above all, his faith, as events unfold in unforeseen and potentially disturbing ways. It’s an evolutionary journey for which he’s unprepared and often unable to fathom, prompting him to question much of what he believes and how he conducts himself. The result is a thoughtful meditation on these issues, featuring positively stunning cinematography, fine performances and superb production values. The pacing is surprisingly well balanced, too, especially for a film with a 2:23:00 runtime, though some of the picture’s montages – as beautiful as they are – probably could have been dialed back somewhat without significantly impacting the finished product. Writer-director Hlynur Pálmason’s fact-inspired tale is arguably his best work to date, but be sure to give this one the time that it deserves to thoroughly appreciate and enjoy it, both for its sheer beauty and for everything it has to say about the divine and the place it occupies in our lives.",7.0
Godland,BornKnight,"A bit slow and vague to my personal taste the movie is divided in two parts that shows the travel and settlement of a young Danish priest (protestant) and photographer to a remote village on Iceland, on the 19th century (then a colony of Denmark, from 1376 to 1918), with distinct languages.

The first part focus on the travel and hardship of the travel with the loss of a friend and rising animosity between the priest and some people of the party; the second part focus on the settlement of the priest and some of the locals, with rising of of disputes and claims, while he involves with the daughter of a local farmer and a builder that acompanished him the first part of the movie.

The photography is marvelous with the Icelandic landscape and to a degree it shows the variation between the seasons and the body and soul of man, that loses gradually his aim and mission till he looses all of his former personality.

But other than that it didn't have a really strong message being more a display of beauty in harshness landscapes and personalities than having a message on itself. For this I score it with a 6.5 out of 10.0 / B-.

Femme,CinemaSerf,"""Jules"" (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett) is a confident drag artist who runs out of cigarettes one night after coming off stage. He sets off to the local shop to replenish and encounters a gang of homophobic chavs. Maybe ill-advisedly, he responds to their taunts and when outside is followed and badly beaten. Not surprisingly, this experience turns the young man into a bit of a recluse. He struggles to come to terms with what has happened and this affects his relationships with flatmates ""Toby"" (John McCrea) and ""Molly"" (Antonio Clarke). His mindset changes, however, after a trip to a sauna re-introduces him to his protagonist ""Preston"" (George MacKay) who aside from being a bit of a thug, is clearly closeted too. The two hook up, it's raw and visceral - and his new mate drives off and leaves him afterwards! This, however, sows a seed in his mind and some You-tubing later leaves him with a plan to film and expose ""Preston"" to the very creatures with whom he exists. What he doesn't quite count on, indeed neither man (nor us) really, follows as the story evolves from one of violence and vengeance into one that might actually touch on something deeper. ""Jules"" learns to adapt to his nemesis's world of drugs, violence and hatred - even to turn it to his own advantage, and that elicits a response from his new found ""friend"" that is almost touching at times... Thing is though, can leopard's change their spots? NJS is superb here but for me it's MacKay who made me sit up and take notice. There is something distinctly authentic about his depiction of this screwed up bully and as the film progresses and the dynamic between the men changes, his is the character that I actually began to feel ever so slightly sorry for. Don't look for vindication at the end, there is a finish to the film but not to the story... This is a well written drama that snacks of realism and reminds us all that bigotry in all it's forms is still alive and well! It's certainly worth watching.",7.0
Boonie Bears: Back to Earth,CinemaSerf,"Well it was tipping down with rain on a Sunday morning, so I thought - let's go see a film. This is all that was on, and though it's not great - it's not dreadful either. A strange, cube-shaped object arrives from outer space and - of course - the first thing we want to do is shoot it down! It crashes into a forest where a group of ecologically-minded beasties live. ""Bramble"" is a rather clumsy, but well-meaning bear who dreams of being a super-hero. He, quite literally, stumbles upon one of the remnants of the ship - and is soon imbued with a wisdom he never had before. Ice cream! That's the cure, so off he sets to his friend's house for a nice sundae. This is where he encounters the original occupant of the ship ""Bobby"" - a cat with ninja skills - and he wants to reclaim his knowledge so he can get his spaceship back and find his ancestral civilisation hidden under the Antarctic ice. Meanwhile, also hunting for the bear is the epitome of glamorous evil, who together with her strong but dim-witted husband wants to re-activate a cyclops-like robot that would give her the ultimate power on Earth. It is quite an interesting film this - not least because I am not sure who it is for. The kids at the screening I attended just were not interested; the colourfully gentle aspects in the plot of cuddly bears and other speaking critters didn't seem to resonate with them. For the adults, it does cut a little deeper - there are messages consistent with a narrative that has shades of ""Forbidden Planet"" (1956) mixed with ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951) warning us of the dangers of technological over-expansion and the de-humanising of society. The animation is proficient, there are some lovely visual effects and the messages of teamwork, friendship and loyalty are engagingly, if rather simplistically, delivered in an undoubtedly overlong 100 minutes. It's real drawback is the seriously mediocre voice talent (on the English version). The budget must have been decent, so why not spend a few more shekels on actors who don't just sound like they could be reading out the menu in a restaurant for their next job. It is worth a look, it is at the more cerebral end of children's animations.",6.0

Building on inventive narrative styles, precise cinematic pacing, superb character development, a knack for capturing the unexpected and impeccable writing quality developed in her recent directorial works “Please Give” (2010) and “Enough Said” (2013), as well as her spot-on screenplay aptitude in “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” (2018), the filmmaker has done it again in this insightful comedy-drama, arguably her funniest and most accessible work to date. Holofcener’s multi-layered storytelling approach covers a great deal of ground, from how much honesty is too much to taking personal responsibility for resolving one’s own issues to wrestling with the ennui of nagging midlife challenges (particularly where matters of career performance are involved), and the overlapping story threads integrate seamlessly, often with carefully crafted, raucously funny boomerang effects. In addition to making viewers laugh, the film also makes them think, serving up incisive scenarios that truly give audience members much to contemplate, including incidents that they might have otherwise failed to consider. This is all stunningly brought to life by the positively stellar ensemble cast, especially Julia Louis-Dreyfus in one of her best-ever lead performances. To be sure, the story meanders a bit at the outset, but the opening act is decidedly designed to set up what’s to come, all of which plays out flawlessly as the picture unfolds. “You Hurt My Feelings” may not conform to convention or deliver what viewers expect going in, but, like a well-prepared dinner, it definitely satisfies one’s appetite for a thoroughly satisfying meal. View hearty, everyone.",9.0

The End We Start From,Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/the-end-we-start-from-bfi-film-festival-review/

""The End We Start From marks debutant Mahalia Belo as a filmmaker to follow closely in the coming years, despite the story not being imaginative or impactful enough to reach a higher level of satisfaction.

With a substantial thematic sense, maternal symbolism is portrayed through Belo's contemplative vision, as well as Susie Lavelle's atmospheric cinematography. However, it's up to Jodie Comer and Katherine Waterston to carry the movie on their shoulders, which, unfortunately, lacks a better exploration of the climate crisis that it uses more as a narrative background trigger.

A more memorable conclusion could have made the difference...""""

The End We Start From,CinemaSerf,"With a fairly biblical storm raging outside, an heavily pregnant mother (Jodie Comer) is sitting at home watching the telly. Power goes out, waters break then the struggle to get boyfriend (Joel Fry) and ambulance to hospital is the start of their woes. Leaving, they discover that huge swathes of England are under water so they head to higher ground and his parents. Fortunately, they have had a long ridiculed bit of a siege mentality so there's plenty of food but that's about all as the family units begin to disintegrate, just as society is doing at large elsewhere. The couple become separated and the un-named mother must now find safety for herself and her baby until some form of normality returns. This is another hugely emotional effort from Comer with Fry, a fleetingly potent contribution from Benedict Cumberbatch and a strong role for new-found friend Katherine Waterson working well, too. The story though - well it reminded me a little of ""Children of Men"" (2006). A rather depressing and dreary chronology - augmented with some flashbacks of happier days - of how individuals deal with disaster, be they self induced or imposed, and I struggled to remain engaged as the narrative lumbered along. The direction and the score are also fairly lacklustre. One too many shots of cars driving along, of mother carrying baby, cheering baby, nursing baby - and talking of the baby, boy does it age! If it's meant to be a very personal, intimate even, indictment of mankind's inhumanity to itself when facing desperation then it just about works, anything else was rather wasted on me, I'm afraid.",6.0

With this one I was 100% it was written by a woman and pleased to find out it was two! Also, a woman director, first feature, yay! I can tell the difference between how we write ourselves. I loved the chemistry between Comer & Waterston. I had never seen the latter actor before and this performance made we want to do a deep dive into her work. Both of them earned these parts for sure and did not rely on their beauty one bit in these performances. Strong women write strong women! Also there's super cute babies in it.

Jules,Brent Marchant,"Seniors often face painfully lonely times by themselves, frequently craving the companionship of virtually anyone who’ll keep them company, even if it’s just someone to listen to them and their stories. Such is the case with Milton Robinson (Ben Kingsley), a 78-year-old widower apparently in the early stages of Alzheimer’s who lives by himself in a small western Pennsylvania town. He has almost no one in his life except for his nagging daughter (Zoe Winters) and two elderly acquaintances (Harriet Sansom Harris, Jane Curtin) who join him at weekly town council meetings. But that all changes with an unexpected event – the crash of a UFO into his backyard azaleas, an incident that unwittingly connects Milton with a seemingly sympathetic but non-speaking alien whom he and his cohorts lovingly name Jules (Jade Quon). This unusual partnership thus provides an unlikely outlet for Milton and company to share their thoughts about loneliness, aging, regrets and other highly personal subjects in frank, sweet and heartfelt (if a bit one-sided) conversations, with Jules serving as an impromptu interspecies sounding board, as it were. But can this relationship be kept secret, especially when Milton casually lets things slip that catch the attention of his fellow townsfolk and snooping government authorities? Director Marc Turtletaub’s latest presents a tender tale of what it’s like to be a senior in America as told from an unconventional standpoint, one full of warmth and sensitivity and peppered with elements of quirky humor and unexpected plot developments, all brought to life by its fine ensemble. However, with that said, the picture is also somewhat uneven in terms of writing, pacing and character development (including, somewhat ironically, that of the title character). While this engaging comedy-drama definitely has its heart in the right place, it nevertheless feels like it should have gone through another round of script revisions before being committed to celluloid. It often feels like it’s drawing upon themes found in “Cocoon” (1985) and “E.T. the Extra Terrestrial” (1982), incorporating them into a story of its own, but it’s that third component that never quite feels complete or thoroughly thought through. That’s unfortunate, because, if the story and screenplay had been more fully developed, that would have made this a much better picture. I truly expect more from the producers who brought us “Little Miss Sunshine” (2006) and “The Farewell” (2019), yet it’s a shame we didn’t get that this time around.",6.0
In from the Side,CinemaSerf,"Alexander Lincoln does quite well here as ""Mark"", a man in a long-term relationship with his frequently absent partner ""Richard"" (Alex Hammond). He plays rugby for a gay team and after one night on the beer finds himself waking up (yep, of course he has managed to put his Calvin's back on in the middle of their night of passion!) next to ""Warren"" (Alexander King). The former has an open arrangement - just never the same person twice - but the latter man has secrets to keep and the two decide to leave it as a fun one night stand. Of course, it isn't that simple. Circumstances conspire and, well you can guess the rather messy rest of the plot. It's far too long, and for me anyway, just reinforced too many stereotypes surrounding hormonal guys who just can't keep their pants on. Loyalty to their rugby team seems disproportionately significant to both men - far more than any integrity with their seemingly faithful boyfriends and I found as this rather plodding affair lumbered on for all but 2¼ hours that though very easy on the eye, the characterisations became increasingly flat and uninteresting. Sure, it's great that the acting talent and the subject matter are dramatising homosexuality in a fashion that is not designed just for a gay audience, but the shallowness of their personas - especially the rather odious ""Gareth"" (a decent effort, too, from Carl Loughlin) just reinforced too many join-the-dot gay attitudes that I found rather underwhelming and just a little disappointing.",6.0
Ordinary Angels,Manuel São Bento,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/ordinary-angels-review-an-optimistic-true-story/

""Ordinary Angels resonates as a powerful reminder of the human capacity for compassion and collective effort in the face of adversity. The sensitive screenplay by Kelly Fremon Craig and Meg Tilly, along with the stirring performances by Hilary Swank and Alan Ritchson, elevate this true story above the ordinary, offering an inspirational viewing experience that is both a celebration of the human spirit and a call to our inherent goodness.

Despite relying on genre conventions, it stands out for its authenticity and the hopeful message it conveys. It’s, without a doubt, a movie that not only warms the heart of everyone who sees it but also prompts reflection on the transformative impact of generosity, altruism, and mutual care in building a better world.""

First, they ALL look older. And that's perfectly fine with me. I'd rather movies show me the reality of growing older than glamorize looking young and beautiful. If you still haven't a clue...""IT'S ALL ABOUT THE ACTING!!!""

It's a gently paced, if procedural, comedy this that allows each of the characters a few scenes to tell us of their woes before a denouement that isn't really a challenge for anyone - watching or acting. We deal with bitterness, misunderstanding, age-old opinions of sex and forgiveness as only an Irish storyline can. Along the way, Kathy Bates proves that she can knock out a tune or two, though I wouldn't give loads for Dame Maggie's backing singing, and the effort from the young, curly-haired, Smith is quite charming. Otherwise this is all just a bit too familiar. It looks charming though and shows us well just how celebratory and simultaneously toxic small community life can be - especially when fuelled by religion.

""Evil Does Not Exist is a disappointing slow-burn that fails to offer a fitting, impactful, complete study of the genuinely interesting central themes linked to nature, sense of community, simplicity of life, and industrial profit fixation.

Technically, no faults: Ryusuke Hamaguchi has a superb crew, using lovely cinematography and an atmospheric score to create an immersive, intricate environment.

The big problem lies in the filmmaker's overconfidence in the audience to develop and finish his own story and respective character arcs, culminating in a disconcertingly shocking, strangely empty ending.""

A Man Called Horse,John Chard,"I'm not a bloody horse!

This is the story of Lord John Morgan, an honest earthy person who is captured by the Sioux in 1825. Abused and treated as an animal he comes to adapt to his life in order to survive. Enduring torture and oppression he must earn their respect in order to be accepted as part of their tribe.

The white man as part of a Sioux tribe story was given a major shot in the arm with Kevin Costner's Oscar bagger, Dances With Wolves in 1990. This picture came out some twenty years before Costner's stylish picture but the two films couldn't be further apart in terms of story telling. Here in Elliot Silverstein's picture, the scenery and scope is certainly lush, but the niceties stop there for this is a harsh, at times painful, story with realism dripping from each frame. Silverstein wanted to get as close as he could to the facts of the Sioux way of life, even bringing in a Sioux historian to oversee the production.

The Sioux are painted on both sides of the canvas, on one side we are shown them to be violent, even sadistic, but Silverstein also portrays them as an intelligent race driven on by intense loyalty to their ways and culture. Richard Harris plays our main protagonist and has a clear license to act with immense verve and vigour, it's a memorable turn that lingers long after the credits roll. Hurting the film is a twee romance between Morgan and the Chiefs daughter (Judith Anderson) and Jean Gascon's fluctuating accents start to grate entering the film's last quarter. But really the plus points far outweigh the little irritants in the piece. The editing from Philip W. Anderson & Michael Kahn is like a whirling paean to hallucinations, and some scenes are from the top draw, most notably the Vow To The Sun ritual that literally is painful to watch. A Man Called Horse may well be of its time, but it's certainly a very interesting and highly intelligent film. 7/10",7.0
The Goldfinger,CinemaSerf,"Back in the 1970s, Hong Kong was riddled with corrupt officials that the Government determined to bring to book. Much to the chagrin of one of the principal culprits - the police - they established an anti-corruption unit charged with addressing this problem, and thanks to one of their lead investigators (Andy Lau) they succeed! Many years later, when the British and Chinese start to talk about the colony's reunification, the Stock Market plummets and he is brought back to investigate the wealthy boss of a large network of companies (Tony Leung) who is living his gilded life of luxury whilst his investors seem to be losing their shirts. As he looks into things more, he discovers an intricate web of subsidiaries, bribery and shell companies that prove to resemble the ultimate in ponzi schemes. It's not just the enterprise that is suspect, but he gradually realises that the dodgy establishment he had hoped he had helped to dismantle years earlier had just, very efficiently, reinvented itself - and it permeates through to the top echelons of society. The film is based on real events and so, like them, we have peaks and troughs as the plot develops. That's where the film rather loses it's way. At it's best, it's tightly structured with a good dynamic between the policeman and his prey. For most of the rest of it, it rather meanders along with a real paucity of detail and little effort to show us just how charisma and charm duped just about everyone. A decent effort from Lau and Leung but it's a long two hours that skimps too much on the interesting aspects of an business that spanned the world at it's peak, run by a sleazy and unscrupulous man.",6.0

""Alice, Darling brilliantly tackles the sensitive topic of abusive relationships. Alanna Francis' script stands out with a profound, respectful look into an emotionally disturbed Anna Kendrick - career-best performance - but also into the genuine best of female friendship.

A non-exploitative look into how psychological violence can be as traumatic as any other kind of physical abuse, as well as how insanely difficult it is to leave such a toxic relationship.

Mary Nighy cannot escape the subgenre's formulaic boundaries, but she should be proud of such an enlightening, impactful feature directorial debut.""

"Alice, Darling",Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**

_This film was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival_

Having experienced a close friend stuck in an emotionally abusive relationship,” Alice, Darling” really hit home. It’s a story (by screenwriter Alanna Francis) that captures the realism of what it’s like as an observer, and what I can only imagine it feels like to be the person suffering in silence. This isn’t a movie that is pleasant to watch, but that’s not why it falters. The themes are absolutely important, but director Mary Nighy chooses a path that feels like an Afterschool Special with its overt messaging. This is what ultimately hurts the film.

Alice (Anna Kendrick) has found her dream man in Simon (Charlie Carrick). He’s handsome, successful, charming, and seems like a good boyfriend. When she agrees to reconnect with her two best friends Sophie (Wunmi Mosaku) and Tess (Kaniehtiio Horn) at a getaway to a quiet lake cottage, they begin to sense something isn’t right. The man is always checking up on her, texting all the time, and making their friend anxious and distant. After Alice spills that she had to lie to Simon and tell him that she’s on a business trip instead of a mini vacation, Tess and Sophie pry deeper. The truth comes to light as they learn that their best friend is trapped in an emotionally and psychologically abusive partnership.

Intimate stories like this expose important issues that are overwhelmingly specific to women. Too many of us know friends or family members who have been through a similar situation, and it speaks volumes that a good number of viewers will relate to this film on a more personal level. It’s easy to judge when it’s not happening to you, and the film is a wake-up call not only for those experiencing abuse to reach out, but for those around them to be alert and learn to spot the red flags that are so easy to miss.

When Nighy chooses to focus on the female friendships and characters, the film is at its best. Kendrick, Mosaku, and Horn have a natural rapport, which makes their performances feel real. Kendrick is especially heartbreaking, and her turn as an anxiety-ridden woman who feels trapped shows an impressive dramatic range. The actors do their best with this story of friendship and abuse, but the material makes for a tough transition from page to screen.

The film’s sluggish pacing is unnecessary, as are the half a dozen scenes of Alice pulling out her own hair. One, maybe two, would suffice and make the point, but Nighy keeps going. There’s also a distasteful subplot about a missing girl who is presumed to be dead. This story line serves as a heavy-handed metaphor that’s tacky and obnoxious, suggesting that is Alice doesn’t leave Simon, she’ll end up murdered in the woods someday, too. I found this component of the story to be so thoroughly off-putting that it overshadowed the rest of the film. The ending is borderline corny camp, too.

“Alice, Darling” tells an important story about how self doubt can be detrimental to finding the courage to stand up, let go, and move on. Too bad it isn’t more subtle (or effective) in its messaging.",4.0
Stranger in the Woods,tmdbHT,"Not recommended, or may be fine as a rental depending on your mood.

1. The pursuit by three separate men of the main character as a love interest was hard to believe - a fiancé, a newly divorced single, and an obsessed creep, all just had to get to her, for some reason? 
2. Character break of the villain somewhere in the middle was also not convincing, as there was zero backstory or indication of pre-existing character flaw.
3. The emergency courtesy text sent by ""close friends""

Golda,Brent Marchant,"Paying homage to a country’s great leader is certainly a worthy and noble undertaking, but, when it comes to director Guy Nattiv’s would-be tribute to Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir (Helen Mirren), the film comes up far short of what it could have been. The film focuses on Meir’s handling of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, when the nation was on the brink of collapse from “surprise” (though strongly anticipated) attacks by Egypt and Syria, largely as retribution for their territorial losses in the 1967 Six-Day War, with significant support from the Soviet Union. The picture presents a detailed by-the-numbers account of the conflict, including Meir’s involvement with her top military advisors and with US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger (Liev Schreiber). Granted, it’s important to understand this background to provide context for the stage on which this drama plays out. However, for a release called “Golda,” one would think that its focus would be on the title character, as a biographical sketch that just happens to be set during wartime. Instead, because of this, Meir is almost reduced to a supporting player in a much wider cast of characters playing out the specifics of the conflict (at least in the first half). There’s virtually no back story about the PM as an individual, providing little insight into who she is and how that impacts her approach to handling the combat. To its credit, the film improves in the second half, especially when it starts presenting Meir’s story from a somewhat more personal perspective. By that point, however, the filmmaker has already lost his audience for what this offering could and should have been. Viewers come away from this one knowing little more about the woman who was a national hero in a time of crisis than what they would likely find in history books and documentary films. In fairness, Mirren and Schreiber deliver fine performances, disappearing into their respective roles and making this production look better than it actually is. But that’s not saying much given what seems to be the genuinely sincere intent that was behind this release. Unlike Meir, this film simply doesn’t rise to the challenge, and that’s unfortunate considering who it is ultimately trying to honor. And, because of that, it should come as no surprise why this offering has ended up in the late summer stash of cinematic also-rans.",5.0
Golda,CinemaSerf,"I suppose this might have been a little bit more interesting if I had known more about the 'Yom Kippur"" war that threatened the still quite fledgling state of Israel. With Egypt and Syria massing huge numbers of troops and tanks on the borders, it falls to the Israeli prime minister Golda Meir (Dame Helen Mirren) to galvanise her hugely outnumbered population and to work with her legendary defence minster Moshe Dayan (Rami Heuberger) to stave off this overwhelming force long enough for her to convince American Secretary of State Henry Kissinger (an almost unrecognisable Liev Schreiber) and his boss Richard Nixon to brave the threats from the Soviets and the Saudis and come to her aid. What's annoying about this film is the astonishing lack of substance to the thing. Much effort has gone into Dame Helen's prosthetics, however much of the rest it seems to repetitively follow her walking about from place to place - with her famous white shoes - whilst lighting and smoking a cigarette. We know she is ill, and we also see from her frequent visits for treatment that the adjacent mortuary is testifying to the increasing horror of this invasion. However there's virtually no detail as to who she is/was, how she got the job, how her intelligence was attained, how her skilful combination of diplomacy and courage all helped to save her nation from annihilation. It's all just presented in a second-rate documentary style that was as unconvincing as it was shallow and episodic. Sure, it illustrates well the perils of war - but, to be honest, it could be any war where one nation was up against a larger, more powerful, one. To do justice to this story and this woman, it needed greater focus and much more detail. This is nobody's finest work here, sorry.",6.0

Afire,Brent Marchant,"Fire is a force that can destroy and devastate, but it’s also one thar can cleanse, sweeping away what’s of questionable value in order to clear space for robust, vigorous, valued new growth. And, sometimes, it can do both simultaneously, as demonstrated in writer-director Christian Petzold’s latest, a searing drama/wry comedy about four old/newfound friends who are unwittingly drawn together at a summer house near the Baltic seacoast. Their time together proves revelatory, stressful and enlightening, in part because of their interactions, the disclosures that come out of those relationships, and the looming threat of ravaging forest fires that threaten them and their existence, both literally and metaphorically. The film is a slowburn in every sense of the word, especially at the outset, with a somewhat cryptic narrative that seems rather meandering at times, but that sets the stage for what’s to follow in the back half. The picture subsequently presents a witty but profoundly insightful examination of what makes us who we are, how much we enjoy or endure our lives, and what we can do to make it better for ourselves when we eliminate what no longer serves us. In many respects, “Afire” is probably not what most viewers will expect, but, then, that’s a huge part of its appeal, a refreshing, engaging look at life and what we make of it, a valuable exercise given how abruptly it can all be taken away, leaving us to ask ourselves, what did we do with the time we had and was it indeed worth it in the end? Give this one time to unfold, and let it sink in. It may help you realize and understand more about yourself than you can possibly imagine.",8.0
Afire,CinemaSerf,"""Leon"" (Thomas Schubert) and his friend ""Felix"" (Langston Uibel) head to a remote rural cottage near the Baltic coast so the former man can put the finishing touches to his novel before a visit from his publisher (Matthias Brandt). They arrive, though, and discover that ""Nadja"" (Paula Beer) is already staying - and this upsets the apple cart a bit. ""Leon"" quickly becomes obsessed - and that only gets worse when her nocturnal activities with life guard ""Devid"" (Enno Trebs) and some wafer thin walls force him to sleep in the garden amongst the mosquitoes. What now ensues is quite an intricately constructed observational presentation that looks at the evolving dynamic between the four - and it doesn't pan out as you might expect, especially once it becomes clear that his latest literary work is nobody's idea of a magnum opus. The characterisations here have a fluidity to them that makes for quite an interesting watch. None of them could ever be described as beautiful - in any classical sense - so the story is much more about their traits, flaws and foibles than about their looks. That works up to a point, but there was too much missing from the puzzle for me to really find myself engaged with any of them. The last twenty minutes - set amidst some lethal forest fires - was rushed and seemed to me indicative that ""Leon"" wasn't the only one who'd suffered from a writer's block! The photography is effectively intimate at times but at other times we see just too many shots walking to and from the beach (and the constant buzzing of the mozzies got on my nerves a bit, too, after a while!).

Beau Travail,CinemaSerf,"Denis Lavant is good in this powerfully delivered reminiscence of soldier ""Galoup"".

The photography here is striking, as is the repetitiveness of their rather pedestrian existence. They spend most of their time, well, killing it! Their perfectly toned bodies frequently exposed to the relentless sunshine - as they do their laundry and their ironing - and to the azure waters of the ocean. For the most part, they are simply bored! It is perhaps that boredom that contributes to the increasingly frustrating existence of ""Galoup"" and of his commander (Michel Subor). It has a degree of violence to it, a physical and  intellectual torment that is well illustrated as the story unfolds slowly but distinctly and not in any way predictably either. This isn't a love story in any traditional guise; but there is affection and sentiment here and as we gradually learn a little of what makes ""Galoup"" tick, I felt a little immersed in his scenario. The music plays a big part here too - not in a soundtrack manner, but augmenting the imagery and standing in for a dialogue that is sparing and effective. It's a slow burn, but I did enjoy it.",7.0

""American Star is a commendable self-reflection character study, bolstered by Ian McShane's brilliantly contained performance, a thematically rich narrative, and a truly gorgeous location.

The contemplative storytelling contributes to an immersive viewing experience about coming to terms with our doings in life, despite some predictability issues and an unnecessary character that robs the movie of a more fitting, emotionally impactful ending.

The Great Escaper,CinemaSerf,"This is one of those contemporary, really quite touching, dramas that we won't be able to make for too much longer. It centres around an elderly couple, who have been together for seventy years, and live a semi-independent life in a care home. During a routine chat with their nurses, ""Rene"" (Glenda Jackson) discovers that her husband ""Bernie"" (Sir Michael Caine) had wanted to go to the impending celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, but that all the tickets had gone. She makes it pretty clear that if he wants to go, well then he ought to just go! Armed with a only a carrier bag and a few quid, he takes a ferry and heads off on a trip that is going to induce some fairly horrific memories of events in 1945 - which we sparingly see in flashback - but is also going to provide him with a degree of fulfilment and closure on issues that have dogged him ever since. Snag? Well he didn't actually tell anyone he was going, so the home are worried, the police are looking and the media soon get hold of his tale of determination and a degree of celebrity beckons. It's a very characterful story, this, with a gentle chemistry between Jackson and Caine, and also between Caine and his newfound travelling companion ""Arthur"" (a proud performance from John Standing) as they both have to face their demons past and present. There's plenty of humour - a decent soupçon of sarcasm; along with a spirit of optimism and reconciliation that works well, without drifting into cheesy sentiment, for ninety minutes. It reminded me of the equally poignant BBC drama ""A Foreign Field"" (1993) and is a good, at times thought-provoking watch.",7.0
"20,000 Species of Bees",CinemaSerf,"Wow! For an actor barely ten years old, this is a masterful performance from Sofía Otero. It's a complex family drama that deals with relationships and identity in a delicate yet potent fashion as a mother ""Ane"" (Patricia López Arnaiz) leaves her busy husband ""Gorka"" (Martxelo Rubio) behind and takes their three children on a trip to see her family. Outwardly, they are a normal enough family unit - they have a few financial worries and at times relationships can be a bit strained, but as we get to now them all a bit better, we discover that Otero's character - a young boy (""Aitor"") by birth but not by nature is seeking the confidence internally and from those surrounding to truly become ""Lucia"". Of course this causes consternation amongst the loving, but confused, parents and family at large - apart from her pragmatic and affectionate, beekeeping, great aunt ""Lourdes"" (Ane Gabarain), who seems to appreciate that the choices being made now by the youngster are visceral and innate. The story allows us to come to our own conclusions about how we might deal with this scenario were we ever to face it - as a child, as a parent, as an extended family member - and, rather effectively here, as a best friend. It has an innocence to it and a poignancy that this young actor encapsulates skilfully and engagingly. Arnaiz, Gabarain and Itziar Lazkano as the grandmother ""Lita"" all add depth to the characterisations and the narrative here too. It can be a bit on the slow side at times, but somehow that doesn't detract too much from the considered style of storytelling going on here. It's thought-provoking and well worth a watch.",7.0
The Shift,Joseph Jeavons,"I was pretty confused as to what was going on, and I wasn’t vibing with the movie very much at the start. But then, out of nowhere, one of the best cinematic scenes in history played on the screen. Kevin denied the devil, and it was absolutely insane. I was sucked in. From there, I had fun trying to decipher the metaphors and plot they had written and ended up loving the film.

Flee,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"Everybody has a story that deserves to be told, and an Afghan refugee’s personal narrative of oppression and the pursuit of a better life is portrayed in “Flee.” Director Jonas Poher Rasmussen animates a discussion between himself and his anonymous friend “Amin,” a man that has had one hell of an existence. Amin recounts his dramatic story through his own words, beginning when he was a young boy in Afghanistan in the 1980s to his incredible journey that made him the man he is today.

The hand-drawn animation is a poetic way to not only tell the man’s story, but to protect his identity. Amin’s life, of which most of it has been spent on the run, is recounted in a series of unbelievable events that are traumatic, heartbreaking, and inspiring. That all of these things happened to one man and he’s still standing is a testament to a human’s will to survive, and I hoped he would eventually get his happy ending (you’ll have to watch the film to see if that happens).

Rasmussen has an empathy towards his subject that’s crucial to making this thoughtful documentary work. Amin feels comfortable opening up to him, and reliving so many painful memories about the horrors he and his family experienced during his lifetime gives the film a very somber tone. From his parents resorting to human trafficking so their kids could have the opportunity to get an education to the sadness of leaving his homeland for Russia during a time of unrest in Kabul, this refugee story spans more than a decade and examines the long-term psychological effects of a lifetime spent running away from oppression and towards freedom.

“Flee” is a personal history brought to life, and Amin eventually reveals a secret that he’s never told another soul. It’s a cathartic exercise of a man confronting his painful past so he can move ahead to a brighter future, and his quest to find a place he can finally call home.",7.0
Flee,badelf,"I loved **EVERYTHING** about this film. Jonas Rasmussen apparently is best friends with Amin, who just happens to be a Afghani who had to escape during Afghanistan's civil war because his father was one of the ""_desaparecidos_"" (to borrow the Chilean term of those silently murdered during Pinochet's rule).

Sounds ordinary? But oh no it isn't.

Now in his mid-30s, living in Denmark, gay, and having a boyfriend who wants to get married, Amin realizes that to have any quality of life, he must confront his past, and the horrible secret he's kept for most of his life. This film is the result.

As if that weren't different enough, Rasmussen animates most of the film in order to protect the actors from the Taliban. Why? Because this is a documentary and a true story.",10.0
Four Daughters,Brent Marchant,"Fusing fact and fiction is a precarious undertaking for a filmmaker, especially when it comes to matters of clarity and credibility. And that’s where this latest offering from writer-director Kaouther Bin Hania misses the mark. This fact-based story about Olfa Hamrouni, a Tunisian single mother who loses her two eldest daughters, Ghofrane and Rahma, to the radical recruitment efforts of ISIL while trying to protect her two youngest daughters, Eya and Tayssir, from befalling a comparable fate struggles mightily to tell a coherent tale. The film clumsily mixes interviews with family members and dramatic reenactments of significant events featuring actors portraying the principals (some inexplicably playing several roles). To complicate matters, this release features an inordinate amount of superfluous material as well as seemingly important gaps in the story, often leaving viewers scratching their heads about how the narrative gets from one unrelated (and sometimes seemingly contradictory) development to the next. Add to that a relevant revelation that doesn’t appear until late in the film (with virtually no prior back story to support it), and you’ve got a patchwork accounting of what otherwise appears to be a moving and heartfelt tale that deserves greater intelligibility and a better overall delivery. What’s more, this offering includes a considerable amount of material about how this production is being put together, a modestly interesting sidebar that might make for an informative bonus feature, but the inclusion of these largely incidental segments within the primary narrative adds little and serves more to needlessly bog down the flow of the film. Given the foregoing, I’m at a loss to understand why this “documentary” (a term I use loosely) has received the amount of attention and adulation that it has garnered, especially in film festival and awards season competitions. Bin Hania has indeed established herself as a talented filmmaker in other releases (especially those of a purely fictional nature), such as the outstanding Oscar-nominated offering, “The Man Who Sold His Skin” (2020), but she seems out of her league here. That’s unfortunate since Olfa’s saga is one that appears to be well worth telling and doesn’t receive the treatment it truly deserves.",4.0
Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya,Ritesh Mohapatra,"Shahid and Kriti's breezy, whacky Rom-Com had immense potential but stumbles due to a lackluster script

""Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya"" offers a desi twist to the romantic comedy genre with a sci-fi touch, distinguishing itself from Hollywood counterparts. While the AI concept brings a whacky idea, the film falters due to mediocre writing, lacking a solid payoff or satisfactory ending. Shahid Kapoor's relaxed charm and magical dance sequences elevate the film, though the direction falls short. Kriti Sanon shines, balancing AI objectivity and warmth in an illogical yet entertaining love story. The noteworthy music, especially ""Akhiyaan Gulaab"" and ""Tum Se,"" earns a place in playlists. Despite lacking top-tier humor, the film serves as a harmless rom-com for Valentine's, particularly for the hopeless romantics.


Full Review :

**Screenplay:**
""Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya"" unfolds with a breezy and harmless romantic comedy screenplay, introducing a unique desi twist to the sci-fi genre. The film maintains a light-hearted tone throughout, preventing the audience from taking it too seriously. However, the AI concept, while whacky, suffers from mediocre writing, leading to occasional drags and an ultimately unsatisfactory ending. The family dynamics portrayed are average, lacking the depth seen in recent dramas. The screenplay struggles to provide a solid payoff, leaving the audience wanting more substance and resolution.

**Performances:**
Shahid Kapoor shines with charm and delivers magical dance sequences, showcasing a relaxed side post his intense roles. Despite the half-baked direction, his performance stands out, adding an enjoyable vibe to the film. Kriti Sanon steals the show, skillfully balancing AI objectivity and warmth in this illogical yet entertaining love story. Her portrayal demonstrates restraint and class, preventing the character from descending into slapstick territory. Supporting roles, particularly Shahid and Kriti's, contribute to the film's overall appeal, but the potential of the cast is hindered by the screenplay's limitations.

**Music:**
The film boasts noteworthy music that becomes a highlight. Tracks like ""Akhiyaan Gulaab"" and ""Tum Se"" set the tone with their vibrant beats, making them standouts. The sensational Varun Jain's humming in ""Tum Se"" and the full-vibe ""Akhiyaan Gulaab"" by Mitraaz add a delightful touch to the soundtrack. ""Laal Peeli Akhiyaan"" carries the right beats for a party cracker. The score, overall, is beautifully composed, earning a spot in the audience's playlists. The musical elements enhance the film's entertainment value, providing a treat for the ears and contributing significantly to its overall charm.

Full Time,CinemaSerf,"This ought to be compulsory viewing for strikers and management alike. The fact that in the 21st century, we are still resorting to these antiquated sledgehammer tactics to deal with industrial disputes is frankly stupefying. Like they say about economic sanctions, they never effect the folks they are intended to, but the ordinary person on the street gets well and truly shafted. ""Julie"" (Laure Calamy) is one such person who is trying to juggle two-children single-parenthood with a shift job as the head chambermaid in a 5-star hotel whilst simultaneously trying to organise an interview with a market research company - her professional background - that will hopefully give her a better and more regular career and allow her to rely less on the increasingly wearying neighbour ""Mme. Lusigny"" (Geneviève Mnich) for childcare. The sense of exasperation felt by the woman throughout this film is palpable. You cannot help but feel sorry for her as she tries to juggle plates galore, keep a grasp on her sanity, keep her job, her temper and stay on the right side of her young children. Most of us who live (or have lived) in an urban area and who relied on mass transportation will appreciate just how poleaxing it can be to your entire life when the things stop running. Calamy's strong and engaging characterisation here offers us a really plausible look at what exhaustion that can cause really looks like. The ending has a redemption to it that has you leaving the cinema with a smile, but for the most part this is actually quite an uncomfortably effective look at how the actions of some - regardless of politics - can seriously screw things up for others. Surely the time has now come for locked doors, bread, water and white smoke?",7.0
Persepolis,CinemaSerf,"""Marji"" is a young girl growing up in Iran just as the imperial Pahlavi regime is toppled and the birth of the Islamic republic proclaimed. Optimism is the order of the day, with everyone hoping the new government will represent new freedoms and liberties for all. Ha! Fat chance, as they say, and things start to become a bit dangerous for this honest and outspoken girl. To avert a familial disaster, her parents manage to get her studying in Vienna, but once there she finds herself immersed in a culture that is alien to her and one that doesn't live up to her (rather naive) expectations. Now she is truly rudderless - where does she belong? Where can she belong? The animation here is quite effective. It's basic, monochrome and at times it's slightly stop-motion style illustrates well the changing politics at home and her own attitudes as she matures and becomes less and less settled. It does cram a great deal in. We move through the decades at breakneck speed which at times disappoints. There are times when I would have liked to linger a bit longer with some aspects of her development, but it's still a lively and thought-provoking watch for much of the time and is well worth a watch.",7.0
Freaks Out,MovieGuys,"Strangely stylish and inexplicably sentimental, with a humanist vibe. That's the feeling Freaks Out left me with. 

There's a really nostalgic feel to this film. It captures a fading world of colourful carnivals and the dubiously named, freak shows, under threat from a Fascist ideology that rejects anyone who is ""different"".

Its underlying message is one of tolerance, forgiveness and acceptance, tempered by the need to protect the vulnerable from persecution. 

Special effects are superb, the story's suitably off beat and affectionately zany and the action is polished. 

An eccentric super hero tale, that's definitely worth a look.",9.0
Ennio,CinemaSerf,"This is a must see for fans of great cinema music. Perhaps alongside John Williams and John Barry, the eponymous maestro has scored in an unique and innovative way, a great many films since the 1960s and this film tracks how he rose from a classical music training to an (eventual) Oscar winner. It does suffer from the perennial problem of films like this, we see (and hear) too little of his marvellous works - especially my own favourite ""Ecstasy of Gold"" - but the narrative offers a quickly paced series of contributions from those well known, and those less so. It is astonishing just how many films he did provide the music for, some of it truly memorable and some of it truly dreadful - but here we see a man who never shied away from pushing the boundaries. His creative use of vocals, even of a typewriter to create his sounds demonstrates well his almost boundless imagination. Though at times a little dry, this documentary lays that skill and passion engagingly before us. Bertolucci, Eastwood and Joffé all contribute in a fashion that avoids the adulatory, and makes this an enjoyable chronology not just of Morricone himself, but of world cinema too.",7.0
Laurence Anyways,badelf,"It would be wrong to call this ""just another TG movie."" It's an intense love story, told in a throwback avant-garde style, which is pretty impressive. I enjoyed both the art that was intended to reflect the lives of two artists, as well as the story. ",8.0
Plan 75,CinemaSerf,"With the ever ageing population putting considerable pressure on the resources of the Japanese government, they pass legislation that will allow any citizen over the age of seventy-five to apply for an assisted suicide programme. They will get $1,000 and an all expenses paid, group, cremation. ""Hiromu Okabe"" (Hayato Isomura) is a young man charged with the administration of applications and he encounters ""Michi"" (Chieko Baishô). This is a lady still pretty sound of mind and body, but who is alone. She feels her existence is a burden, her home is soon to be demolished and it's fair to say that she sees little purpose in continuing to go through the motions. The young man also encounters an elderly gentleman - his estranged uncle ""Yukio"" (Take Takao) who is of a similar state of mind and although he cannot deal with this case directly, this triumvirate of individuals serve as a potent conduit for some thought-provoking cinema. ""Hiromu"" treats 'Plan 75"" (curious that it is titled and branded in English) as a job. He has little personal investment in any of his clients - until, that is, he faces some personal conflict. Meantime, ""Michi"" has been chatting to a young lady who is on the telephone for support purposes and gradually their chatting leads to a bond and perhaps she begins to have doubts? As the threads gather together the film starts to become faintly silly - the ending is flawed on quite a few levels for me - practical and philosophical, but this story still offers us food for thought as we consider just how arbitrary age is when we evaluate suitability for things. Society uses it all the time - when we can start doing something and when we ought to stop. It rarely, if ever, looks at the particulars of the individual - it just makes simplistic generalisations. This film goes some way to challenging that perspective and though I was quite disappointed with it's lack of focus and slightly meandering narrative, Baishô and Isomura deliver well and it's certainly something to think about.",6.0
Plan 75,YouShouldKnow,"Great concept, poor execution. The images were well-done and the colors chosen to give the feeling of seeming hopelessness from the main characters.
However, the story is way, way, way too slow. In fact, there isn't really a story at all. This could is a ""slice of life"" movie that feels like it's going at the pace of life.

It's not clear whether the pace and chosen script were due to budgetary constraints, but as many ""winners of cannes film festival"", this is just a great idea waiting for a better remake. 

Many things could've been explored like the turbulent events that led to the law being adopted, a story following the people protesting the adoption and how they eventually lose, a jump forward a decade or more where taking advantage of plan 75 is normal, or a reality TV-esque documentary of the first 75 year old living the life with the money received from the scheme, etc.

Article 20,CinemaSerf,"The topic here is quite an interesting one. A CCTV camera captures a man being attacked and stabbed multiple times. The police apprehend the perpetrator, but as the hastily partnered prosecutors - ""Han Ming"" (Jiayin Lei) and ""Liu Lingling"" (Ye Gao) start to investigate, they discover that the victim was actually quite an odious creature who probably deserved his fate - despite the vocal protestations of his family. Meantime, the former is also having some family drama after is son ""Yuchen"" (Liu Yaowen) intervenes in a school bullying incident and finds himself faced with making an humiliating apology or a court-ordered detention. Poor old ""Han"" is now under mounting pressure from his bosses, his partner and from his rather strong-willed wife ""Li Maojuan"" (Li Ma). Juggling plates isn't really his forte, and for most of the drama we vacillate between the increasingly hysterical and bickering marital relationship that starts off quite funny but ends up quite grating, and a police investigation that ultimately has a political point to make about the voracity of Chinese justice to the audience. It does have it's moments, and at times I did feel a bit sorry for ""Han"" as his problems accumulate with no obvious solution for a man who just wants to get to his retirement in one piece. Otherwise, though, it's all a bit messy. The narrative doesn't really flow and it becomes just a but too much of a soap for me as it begins to run out of steam. It is watchable, and at times does raise a smile - but the stories are all just a bit too thin.",6.0
My Sailor My Love,CinemaSerf,"James Cosmo is quite good here in one of his few leading roles. He is ""Howard"", a curmudgeonly old gent who lives alone - washing his smalls in the kitchen sink and caring little about anything but his crossword puzzle. His daughter ""Grace"" (Catherine Walker) is at the end of her tether, so she employs local lady ""Annie"" (Brid Brennan) to do a bit of housekeeping for him. He is not at all keen on this arrangement; indeed is so rude as to have her walk out on him, but a few of her more homely touches make him begin to realise that the pit into which his life has slid is perhaps not the only solution. Pretty quickly the two are getting on like an house on fire and gradually this causes a degree of chagrin for the daughter who sees her own role in his life beginning to become less crucial - as she, herself, is watching her own marriage disintegrate. Can they all find a way to make things work? It's a gentle romance this film, with some enjoyable and poignant performances from the three principals that highlights how people cope with grief, loneliness and opportunity. Director Klaus Härö allows the talent to deliver a considered series of portrayals that marry the happy and the sad in a plausible fashion. I can't say I loved the ending. Though perfectly realistic, it seemed a little unnecessary to me - but you be the judge. It doesn't need a cinema screen, but is well worth watching the loads of experience at character acting ooze from Brennan and Cosmo.",7.0
Joyland,Faraz Khan,"I guess people have forgotten the difference between the meanings of ""promotion"" and ""depiction"". For those who really don't know what these words mean: promotion means to encourage, to support something. And depiction means to show something, to make people aware of something by showing it to them.

Now, Joyland, nowhere in its 126 minutes run supports or encourages or ""promotes"" homosexuality or anything that is anti-Islamic. In fact, this isn't even the only theme of the film. It covers pretty much every aspect of the domestic life of a lower middle-class Pakistani man and a woman (I didn't mention transgender persons because those poor things have only one class of lifestyle). It shows every harsh reality of our society. It shows all the plagues our country is being devoured by, those which aren't remotely related to Islam but have become a part of our tradition despite being highly toxic. These are the stigmas that we suffer from in our lives but no one wants to get rid of them because they have been here for so long that they have become normal. And a life without them would be abnormal or even disgraceful and shameful according to our ""elders"".

The film does show the homosexuality that exists in our country. It doesn't tell whether its good or bad, it just shows it. The only thing that could be a negative point in my opinion would be the graphic scenes. They weren't really that necessary.

In the end, I would say that Joyland is probably the best film that's come out of Pakistani industry in a long time. We need to support such films and accept the existence of all the brutalities of the society they make us aware about. And lastly, try to do something about them.",10.0
Joyland,CinemaSerf,"The title here is a theme park that features only tangentially in this enjoyable and potent tale of ""Haider"" (Ali Junejo).

He is a bit put upon: he must carry out many of the household chores - even doing the ironing for his brother ""Saleem"" (Sameer Sohail). His brother has just had a child - another daughter and his father (Salmaan Peerzada) is desperate for a boy to carry on the family name. ""Haider"" goes and gets himself a job - and an unlikely one, at that. HeThanks to his friend, he auditions for a dancer's job at the local theatre and despite having two left feet, manages to secure a job at ₹40,000 per month for just two concerts. He fibs to his family about the exact nature of the job, and is soon flailing around at the behest ""Biba"" (Alina Khan) who is the undoubted star of the show. As we progress, however, we discover that there is a bit more to ""Biba"" the originally thought and as the two become friends we also discover a little more behind the reasons why a son is so slow in coming for the otherwise loving married couple. There is an effective chemistry between Khan and Junejo and as the story unfolds we are exposed to quite a few scenarios that challenge established (admittedly, Western) views of just how society should operate - from the role of both women and men through to the increasingly obvious issues faced by people who don't run in that linear two-horse race. It is funny at times and the dialogue is efficient at helping this characterful story along towards the denouement. Now this is where I felt a little disappointed. Not that it doesn't work - but somehow it seemed to me to be a bit of a sad cop-out from the writers who almost seemed to go along with the prevailing spirit of compliance at all costs. Still, you must judge that for yourselves if you watch it - which I suggest that you do.",7.0
Benediction,CinemaSerf,"Whilst at times a bit messy, Terence Davies and Jack Lowden have put together quite a compelling story of the life (and loves) of acclaimed British poet Siegfried Sassoon. Though not a conscientious objector - he got an MC in France during WWI, he regaled against the wartime policies of the Government and was invalided to an hospital near Edinburgh, where under the care of Dr. Rivers (Ben Daniels) he began to explore his sexuality and to fall in love for the first time (here, with an other equally acclaimed WWI poet Wilfred Owen (Matthew Tennyson)). The film uses two timelines to tell the story. The first, more of a chronology as Sassoon meets and loves the handsome yet frequently unreliable and scathing Ivor Novello (Jeremy Irvine) and Calam Lynch's excellent portrayal of Stephen Tennant. The second, less developed, strand takes a more up-to-date position with Peter Capaldi, a somewhat disillusioned and curmudgeonly old fellow. As the young man's story is told, we begin to understand a little more about why the older is whom he has now become - and that is all told poignantly with a gentle, if sparing, contribution from Gemma Jones as his long-suffering wife. Intercut with actuality from the Somme (not for the squeamish) and with the on-form Lowden (who frequently reminds be, here, of James McAvoy) reading some of Sassoon's more potent poetry and, especially at the end reading one of Owen's, this stylishly produced film provides much food for thought. The quality of the narrative ebbs and flows a bit, but for the most part it works well with an excellent ensemble in support. The marvellously catty Simon Russell Beale as Robbie Ross and Lia Williams as a superbly aloof Edith Sitwell make for a characterful study of a class of society in which homosexuals thrived; creatives created and stress, guilt and angst were really and enduringly affecting the lives of all.",7.0
The Mission,Brent Marchant,"Is religious missionary work an act of altruism or arrogance? Does it represent a quest for the fulfillment of one’s spiritual potential or a euphemistic cover for an inflated sociopathic ego? And, in either case, is it even possible to distinguish the two? Those are legitimate questions in the case of 26-year-old fundamentalist Christian missionary John Chau, who disappeared and was presumed dead in 2018 while attempting to spread the word of Jesus to the reclusive indigenous residents of North Sentinel Island, an Indian protectorate in the Bay of Bengal. The locale, one of the world’s most difficult destinations to reach and one that’s strictly off limits to outsiders, is home to an obscure, little-known tribe with a reputation for being mistrusting of and unwelcoming to strangers. Yet Chau was convinced that it was his destiny to convert them to Christianity no matter what, even at the cost of his life, a concern that worried his family, friends and seasoned missionaries who had attempted comparable initiatives with native people in other parts of the world. It was an effort that raised questions about Chau’s motivations: Was he a committed religious zealot who truly wanted to spread the word of Christ, or was he suffering from a maniacal Messiah Complex hell-bent on testing the limits of his courage, hubris and personal capabilities? Directors Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss seek to answer these and other thorny questions about this enigmatic individual whose real intents may never really be known, leaving lingering doubts and pain about his mission in the minds of those who knew him. Thanks to unprecedented access to Chau’s kindreds, as well as his recovered diaries, the filmmakers tell a captivating tale about his experience, along with thought-provoking ethical examinations about the nature and propriety of missionary work in connection with indigenous societies. Should it continue? Is it appropriate for Westerners and devout Christians to interfere in the spiritual lives of those who adhere to alternate viewpoints? Indeed, are these people genuinely in need of being “fixed,” regardless of the alleged nobility behind the intentions of those seeking to carry out these transformations? “The Mission” offers viewers a delicately balanced view of these notions, prompting even the most dedicated disciples of this work to step back and take a new look at what they and their peers are carrying out. It also presents an eye-opening discussion of this subject, encouraging us to ask ourselves, how much is too much when it comes to missionary work, regardless of the religion involved? And when is it appropriate to leave things as they are for those who already appear to be happy and contented in their lives and beliefs? There’s a lot on the line in this Critics Choice Documentary Award nominee, and, in light of the nature of its story, that’s something we must never lose sight of.",9.0
Disco Boy,CinemaSerf,"If you're expecting some Bee Gees or Donna Summer here, then you're going to be disappointed. Indeed there's precious little disco at all in this story of ""Alex"" (Franz Rogowski). He and his friend ""Mikhail"" (Michal Balicki) have a cunning plan to get from their home in Belarus to Poland and then on to France where they may eventually gain citizenship by joining the Foreign Legion. That doesn't quite go to plan, but eventually he finds himself at boot camp and destined for a mission to Niger. It's there that the local ""MEND"" militia are demanding an end to the cavalier exploitation of the delta by oil companies leaving a trail of death, destruction and pollution behind them. A violent encounter with local leader ""Jomo"" (Morr Ndiaye) in a river ends up having quite a profound effect on our soldier, one which he must come to terms with when he returns to Paris and meets the enigmatic dancer ""Udoka"" (Laetitia Ky) - who would appear to be as connected with his recent past as with his present. The story itself is but an incomplete section of his life, it's the photography that makes this more interesting. The use of night-vision imagery, especially in the jungle, works well as does the presentation of the environmental carnage being left behind - oil leaking everywhere, discarded or bombed out pipelines. That sense of the invasive nature of industrial development is quite cleverly carried onwards as ""Alex"" and his colleagues themselves have little investment in anything but survival. There's not a great deal of dialogue - wanted or needed, and this is the sort of part Rogowski does well - he's neither here nor not a lot of the time. It has a slightly surreal look to it, and though maybe it does meander a little - it certainly does repeat itself now and again - it's still quite a compelling mix of the political and the emotional, and is worth a watch.",7.0
Shayda,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**

The tenacity of a mother’s love provides the strong foundation for writer / director Noora Niasari‘s “Shayda,” a harrowing portrait of an Iranian woman who is doing her best to make the most of a terrible situation. This intimate story is one of female empowerment and endurance in a cultural system that often treats females as second class citizens.

Shayda (Zar Amir-Ebrahimi) is a young mother who, with her 6-year-old daughter Mona (Selina Zahednia) has fled her horribly abusive husband Hossein (Osamah Sami) and moved into a women’s shelter in Australia. Shayda has bravely filed for divorce and is now an outcast in her own community. Constantly living in fear yet seeking a fresh start for herself and her daughter, Shayda struggles to provide a safe, calm, and normal home for her child. The two are getting by fairly well and enjoying their newfound freedoms until they get the troubling news that a judge has granted Hossein visitation rights. A dangerous situation is created when he reenters their lives and begins spending more time with his child, which causes Shayda to live in constant fear that Hossein will try to kidnap Mona and take her back to Iran.

Niasari’s story explores the trauma of a sexually, physically, and emotionally abusive relationship and celebrates the sheer perseverance that one woman possesses when it comes to protecting her daughter from harm. This female-focused film addresses the cultural norms of Shayda’s home country of Iran, a place where women live with a lack of legal autonomy and have weak protections from serious things like domestic violence, and when they push back against discriminatory practices and laws, they are often arrested or given death sentences. It’s sad and infuriating how women are treated, especially those who are seeking a divorce. Niasari effectively expresses the agony, horror, and vulnerability that a soon-to-be single mother must deal with in order to liberate herself from a life of maltreatment.

Amir-Ebrahimi gives a strong performance in the lead role, and she expresses a universal empathy and determination that is inspiring. Equally effective are Zahednia as a frightened innocent, and Sami as a charmer of an abuser who swears he’s changed (thankfully, Shayda knows better).

“Shayda” is a solid drama that’s politically-minded, timely, and engaging. It can be tense and difficult to watch at times, but as the titular character begins living life on her own terms, things that once felt menacing now seem liberating.",7.0
One and Only,CinemaSerf,"""Ding Lei"" (Bo Huang) is a veteran boss of the E-Mark street dancing team. His renowned lead dancer ""Kevin"" (Casper Chu) is a bit of a prima-donna and so when he alights on ""Chen Shuo"" (Wang Yibo) who is an hard working family lad to come along and help at the practice sessions then divisions soon appear and the battle lines are drawn for the ultimate in dancing challenges at the national championships. The story here is not great - nor, indeed as is the acting nor the writing. What is captivating, though, is the gravity-defying acrobatics as these guys spin, pivot and fly through the air with astonishing skill and dexterity. It's also illustrative of just how this art serves as an aspirational conduit for young men who have little by way of opportunity to escape from the mundanity of their day-to-day lives. Personally, I find Yibo Wang just bit too weedy as an actor - he's actually always a bit of a drip - but essentially this is a triumph for the choreographers art and the adroitness and spontaneity of the dancers that really delivers excitingly for the last twenty minutes.",6.0
Raging Grace,CinemaSerf,"""Joy"" (Max Eigenmann) is struggling to find work and bring up her young daughter ""Grace"" (Jaeden Paige Boadilla) in a Britain where she has no legal status. That sends her down the agency cleaning route where she arrives at the large home of ""Katherine"" (Leanne Best) who is looking after her bedridden elderly uncle ""Garrett"" (David Hayman). Now her new employer knows nothing of the daughter, even though her's is a live-in appointment. It's only when ""Katherine"" has to go away for a weekend leaving the elderly man - and his medication - in her care, that ""Grace"" can be herself a bit more and we start to realise that there's something fishy going on. Indeed, a mishap with the pills starts to enliven this hitherto husk of a man and we soon start to wonder if ""Katherine"" isn't up to no good. The enigmatic ""Garrett"" is clearly no saint either, and though he befriends the curious and friendly ""Grace"" with hot chocolate, it's increasingly clear that he too has an agenda - especially when her mother is rounded up by immigration officials. Most of this film is actually unremarkable, but the last half hour or so does liven it up a little as all of the characters start to come into play and the story begins to pick up some pace. Hayman delivers quite well, keeping us guessing for a while about the true nature of his character, but the rest of the acting and the writing are neither here nor there and there is much too much preamble. The denouement reminded me a little of something Edgar Wright might have delivered, but otherwise it's not really much more than an OK watch.",6.0
Tótem,CinemaSerf,"I'm not usually fan of children in films, but boy - Naíma Sentíes' performance here as the young ""Sol"" is terrific. She, replete with multicoloured curly wig is with her mother preparing for a party to celebrate her father's birthday. What we learn from very early on is that her dad ""Tona"" (Mateo Garcia) is very unwell. Indeed, from the brief scene we see of him in the shower - this is a twenty-seven year old not destined to survive much longer. Clearly that information is known amongst the man's family and friends with his sisters, and his father, taking quite distinctly differing approaches to dealing with their impeding loss. The story takes it's time, but it's never dull. The observational nature of the drama, and the hugely charismatic effort from the young Sentíes is enthralling to watch as their day continues revealing stresses, strops, strains and a slightly defiant degree of optimism. As ensemble performances go, Marisol Gasé, Montserrat Marañon and Teresa Sánchez ensure that this well cast and presented story of a family in distress works evocatively. There are few tantrums, just a stoicism and dignity that makes this really quite a poignant story of a young girl - and a family - that doesn't quite appreciate that life is soon to change for ever.",7.0
Tótem,Brent Marchant,"The everyday lives of average individuals ordinarily might not make for especially engaging storytelling. However, when they’re framed within the context of extraordinary circumstances, they take on an added new dimension, as witnessed in the second offering from Mexican writer-director Lila Avilés. This warm, heartfelt, bittersweet comedy-drama tells the endearing story of a family hosting a birthday party for Tona, a young, beloved painter battling advanced cancer (Mateo Garcia Elizondo), told largely through the perspective of his seven-year-old daughter, Sol (Naíma Sentíes), who hopes against hope for her father’s recovery. As events play out, viewers watch as Tona’s family makes preparations for the celebration – often involving simple tasks told with delightfully funny twists that provide much-needed comic relief – as well as the various means with which his relatives are dealing (or not dealing) with an apparently impending inevitability that no one really wants to address or discuss. Yet what might seem destined to be an exercise in forced festivities with an underlying sense of morbidity turns out to be a loving, earnest celebration of life, despite the undeniable presence of an unwanted, intangible “guest” lingering in the background. While the film incorporates a few sequences that are inherently a little too incidental in nature compared to the larger overall narrative, “Tótem” nevertheless serves up a charming, touching, authentically presented tale that reaches out to audiences and surrounds them with sincere, loving feelings and a big, well-earned hug. This National Board of Review winner and Independent Spirit Award nominee is a fine, little-known indie gem that will surely move you, even if it leaves you with uncomfortably mixed feelings as its story unfolds. It effectively illustrates that there indeed can be times of boundless, overwhelming joy even in the face of overwhelming lament but that what ultimately matters most is what we make of these circumstances when they play out, especially when it comes to expressing how we feel for those whom we truly care about most.",8.0
The Beast,CinemaSerf,"Though it's really way too long, I did rather enjoy the developing chemistry here between Léa Seydoux (""Gabrielle"") and George MacKay's ""Louis"". The story isn't really structured, it's all largely dictated from her consciousness lounging in the bath of Guinness no longer needed by ""Baron Harkkonen"" where she is having her DNA cleansed. This is ostensibly to make her life happier and more fulfilled, to take the rough edges off disappointment and pain - and generally to turn her into a rather soporific drone. The thing is, whilst plugged in and gently soaking we discover that her brain isn't co-operating with the process and that she is having very lifelike fantasies - historical, contemporary and futuristic with the handsome and enigmatic ""Louis"". The story in itself isn't really up to very much. It's an episodic jaunt through what is/was/might be their lives - together and apart. What does work well is the ambiguity. The sense that artificial intelligence, either working on it's own or at the behest of humanity, can rearrange our thoughts and our memories. It can create as convincingly as it can delete comprehensively - and all because there is a sense that emotions are unpredictable, unreliable and therefore a threat to the stability of a new ""natural order"". The dialogue can meander into the realms of psycho-babble now and again which does detract from the subtle but clear thrust of the narrative, but it is actually quite a scary prognosis of what might become fact if we are not careful to protect what is real and important.",7.0
The Inseparables,CinemaSerf,"If you're up on your Cervantes, then you will appreciate just why ""Don"" is fed up with being the butt of all the jokes amongst his puppet fraternity and so, in despair, sets off to tilt at a few windmills (without or without distressed ducklings). Along the way, he encounters the battery powered ""DJ Doggy Dog"" and they have some fun adventures together rescuing the needy. Meantime, back at their home the other puppets are under threat from two young burglars who want to kidnap and sell them. It's just by pure chance that our two dragon-defeating cavaliers stumble upon the warehouse where his erstwhile friends are being held captive. Can they figure out a way to save them from the bubblewrap? This is quite a fun action film that's peppered with some fun dialogue, imaginary derring-do and it delicately reinforces messages of team-playing, loyalty, family and not getting your electronic toys wet! The pace is quite good, the animation engaging to watch and though I'm not entirely sure what demographic it's aiming for, I still found it entertaining with a slightly more grown up ""Pinocchio"" style of storytelling.",6.0
Bleeding Love,CinemaSerf,"The family McGregor must have decided that a dad/daughter road movie was just what we all needed, so Ewan and Clara set about manufacturing this really rather unremarkable and tedious drama. We gather from fairly early on that their's is a strained relationship and he has a lot of ground to make up with a daughter who has just emerged from the ER but a few hours earlier. Of course all the details of that duly unfold and the usual smattering of entirely predicable familial baggage is also unpacked for us as this trundles along. Luckily (for us) their truck breaks down and that offers us a chance to meet the entertaining tow-truck driver (Kim Zimmer - easily the highlight of the whole enterprise) and as it's fixed, un-named daughter sneaks a few snifters with ""Kip"" (Jake Weary) before dad saves the day and on they travel. She's a bit prone to toilet stops, and on one she unknowingly encounters a little spider that leaves quite an agonising gift in her nether regions. Luckily, again, we have a local hooker on hand who knows just how to apply the ice and yep, more tarmac and white lines.... Road movies work if you care about the passengers. I can honestly say that I didn't at all here. I'm a bit weary of these stories that just show us yet another dysfunctional relationship being played out against a background of desertion or addiction or adultery or just plain boredom, and I am afraid that much of the tortuous and over-delivered dialogue did little to engage me further. It didn't need a big budget, the production is fine - but the story and both performances here are just yawn, yawn, yawn. Sorry.",6.0

Shoshana,CinemaSerf,"This is a curiously undercooked iteration of a story that well exemplifies that expression about one man's terrorist being another's freedom fighter. It's the underwhelming Douglas Booth who is Wilkin, a police detective based in British-administered Palestine and a man who has a semblance of decency to him. His boss ""Chambers"" (Ian Hart) is a bit more of a player, though - and he drafts in the much more ""hands-on"" Morton (the unremarkable Harry Melling) to get results more quickly - not least the apprehension of Stern (Aury Alby) who is determined to establish a Jewish homeland and doesn't much care which tactics he uses to accomplish that. The personal story is largely historical fact, so there's no real jeopardy here, but it's an interesting postulation on just how the British tried to administer a region and a population that had no interest in being administered, and that was being logistically manipulated with the shortest of term vision for anyone's future. Palestinian and Jew could agree on just one thing - get the UK out, but thereafter there was little consensus as the bombs and the bullets continued to fly. To be honest, I found the contribution of the eponymous woman (Irina Starshenbaum) to be almost incidental to what is essentially a rather dryly brutal story of a territory that always has been and will be fought over. It looks fine, but somehow it's all just a little too bitty - episodic, even, and it needed a bigger hitter to deliver the narrative more engagingly and convincingly. Pity.",6.0
The Moon Thieves,CinemaSerf,"Though it does over-complicate the plot at times. I did quite enjoy this daft crime caper set amidst the world of luxury watches. ""Vincent"" (Edan Lui) is a bit of a whizz when it comes to creating fake watches. He scavenges original parts, though, he is no cheap and cheerful merchant. He's also got a game going validating valuable timepieces for the wealthy, but clueless, folks who rather foolishly trust him to be honest!! Anyway, the plastic jacket-clad local kingpin ""Uncle"" (Keung To) - who looks about twelve - has his eyes set on a triptych of one-off devices that were supposedly worn by Picasso and lost after his death. They've turned up for auction in Tokyo, so ""Vincent"" is cajoled into the project along with his handsome buddy ""Yoh"" (Anson Lo) and two henchmen - the ""Chief"" (Louis Cheung) and his dim-witted muscle ""Mario"" (Michael Ning) and soon enough they are in Japan laying the plans for an intricate sting operation. ""Vincent"" has had a lifelong passion for the ""Moonwatch"". This is the watch worn by Buzz Aldrin when he went to the moon - but it, too, has disappeared. When it turns out that it, too, is at the same jewellers the whole carefully orchestrated operation goes a bit awry and that causes all of our would-be thieves to think again about what they are doing, why they are doing it - and just what's the motive of their childlike boss back home. Lui is quite efficient here as the boffin-thief, and there's a decent pace as the drama, peppered with a little comedy and an entertaining heist scenario flows along well enough until the lively conclusion. That's a wee bit convoluted, but it just about works with a solid production, not too much script and a few engaging on-screen performances from a cast who looked like they were enjoying this lark.",7.0
Scala!!!,CinemaSerf,"This is quite a fascinating documentary following the fate of a cinema that even John Waters said ""shocked him"". It wasn't always on the same site in Central London, but the ""Scala"" name quickly became a magnet for all those who didn't conform to the more mainstream - with their own behaviour and/or attitudes and/or taste in films. Using an astonishing amount of well researched actuality and some interviews with the folks who worked there or attended over the years, we learn of a place that offered a venue for any combination of the Bohemian, the decadent, the drugged up, boozed up, gay - and, yep, even the serious film goer as it originally opened and closed many years later with ""King Kong"" (1933)! I did live in London in the late 1980s and King's Cross was a dump - full of hookers, rent boys and you never strayed far from an heroin needle. The ""Scala"" thrived amidst this alternative and hedonistic environment and though I don't know that I quite qualify for the groups that regularly used the place after midnight, my two visits were fun and never intimidating - the sound system there was not the best! Porn, horror, martial arts, cartoons - nothing was off limits until the local council took exception to ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971) and the subsequent legal fracas pretty much put paid to the place as a cinema. It's split into parts that illustrate the rise and fall of what was essentially an establishment that didn't really matter in which building it was located. Sticky floors, sticky seats, dark ""back massages"" offering a range of facilities from a sleeping berth to a shagging one. It can't resist the usual bit of Mrs. Thatcher-bashing at the end which adds a bit of authenticity to a cinema that existed precisely because it was so anti-establishment and pro free-spirit. It reminded me a little of the ""Studio 54"" (2018) documentary. A place that was legendary and fun and necessary - probably still is. Very watchable on a big screen if you can.",7.0
High & Low – John Galliano,CinemaSerf,"I think Kevin Macdonald has tread a fine line quite carefully here as he uses a candid interview with John Galliano as the bedrock for a retrospective on the career of this enigmatic and undoubtedly flawed individual. From his graduation from St. Martin's College in London through to his ill-fated custodianship of Haute Couture at Dior, we follow this man on a warts and all documentary that is substantially supported by some seriously good archive research and some equally frank contributions from friends and foes alike. As someone put it in the narrative, some of his fashions did beg the questions ""who for?"" and ""where?"" and that is part of what makes this interesting. The association behind the more obscure of his high end fashion (especially his Egyptian-inspired designs that even Elizabeth Taylor might struggle with) through to the more scantily clad and ambiguous creations with that worn by the ordinary person shopping on the high street is always a curiously, obliquely, tangential one! The film tells us about the man, certainly, but also about the vagaries of an industry that pushes, drives, rewards and punishes in equal measure. What is clear from early on here is that Galliano became addicted to almost everything - from the varied contents of a bottle, or to a pencil and a pair of scissors, or just to the lucrative adulation that created a ""Hyde"" at times from his original ""Jekyll"". The fact that he clearly has little actual memory of the incident in the Café de la Perle that brought about his downfall is testament to his complete lack of self awareness and control by this point in his career. Burning the candle at both ends and in the middle would, I suspect, turn most of us into mush. Macdonald doesn't attempt to coax us in any given direction regarding our reaction to this incident, and to the fall out. Galliano has his opponents and his proponents. We are presented with as much fact as there is, plenty of prognostication - and left to conclude just how evil (or not) he is/was/may still be. It also gives us a chance to look in the mirror and ask ourselves where forgiveness may lie... It's entertaining at times, and the pictorial documentation of his career and that of many of his contemporaries is a must watch for anyone interested in the development of, and fascination in, this industry.",7.0
Do Not Expect Too Much from the End of the World,CinemaSerf,"There's something very natural about Ilinca Manolache in this gritty and occasionally quite funny story of ""Angela"". She seems to spend much of the film driving her car around the streets of Bucharest garnering interviews from the victims of industrial accidents. Why? Well apparently some Austrians are making a safety film and they want a real person to go on screen advocating the common sense of adhering to the rules! Don't go pole vaulting over a volcano kind of thing. As she becomes increasingly weary, being sent from one end of the city to the other, she encounters some of the more moronic road users and that allows the dialogue to get ripe and lively - much to the chagrin of her mother. Anyway, eventually she alights on one would-be contributor who seems quite happy to do whatever is required for his €500 fee - but it's at this point, and through the subsequent quite scathingly delivered production process that I found the whole thing pretty much ground to an halt - despite the briefest contribution from Uwe Boll. The pithy and characterful ""Angela"" becomes trapped in a repetitive series of similar scenarios - interspersed by some foul-mouthed and sexually charged rants from her alter-ego video blogger ""Bobita"" and the odd deferential reference to the recent death of HM Queen Elizabeth II. Meantime - and these scenes are in a nicely photographed-to-look-dated colour, we flit back to the Romania of Ceausescu where ""Angela Moves On"" - a fictitious film from 1981 depicts the life of a taxi driver who finds her daily grind not dissimilar to the modern day story. Misogamy and sexism thriving unfettered! Unfortunately, after about an hour I was really struggling to stay interested. It all went from being entertainingly plausible to overly and rather unpleasantly contrived and at just shy of 2¾ hours long, it really does lose it's way just once too often. To be fair to the writers, the pace of the dialogue is thick and fast and it does take a few swipes at the modern day opt-in culture, but we spend far too much time in her car - she changes gear a lot - and I'm afraid I really rather gave up. It could easily have lost an hour, tightened up what's quite a fun and politic premiss and been much better. As it is, it's all just a bit disappointing.",6.0
Table for Six 2,CinemaSerf,"Whilst I did enjoy the first, more concentrated, outing for our three couples, this one descends just a little too much into farce for me. The plot all centres around the wedding banquets of the couples who, bluntly, are marrying the wrong folk! As the big day approaches, so does a surfeit of slapstick comedy that takes a swipe at many of the daftest traditions of (any) marriage ceremonies, whilst also aiming squarely at people who exploit weddings. ""Bernard"" (Louis Cheung) and ""Monica"" (Stephy Tang) now run a wedding planning agency - and not very efficiently either. Their incompetence is just the tip of the iceberg as ""Lung"" (Peter Chan) and ""Josephine"" (Ivana Wong) get embroiled in a publicity grabbing fiasco and poor old ""Meow"" (Lin Min Chen) - well she just pines. Why? Well that's because there's no big brother ""Steve"" (Dayo Wong) here, and that throws the rest of the dynamic a bit out of kilter. On the plus side we do learn a little about synthetic shark-fin soup and luckily pop idol ""Mark Gor"" (Jeffrey Ngai) is prepared to get his shirt wet to divert attention when the predictable familial catastrophes all loom large and the enterprise of the scheme gets well and truly beamed up. There are a few laugh out loud moments, but this is just nowhere near as intimate and engaging as the original gathering of the six. Please let's leave it alone, now?",6.0

The Jungle Bunch 2: World Tour,CinemaSerf,"The legendary ""Jungle Bunch"" are just looking to settle down to a peaceful life when they emerge from their cave one morning to a forest covered in a purple powder. Harmless unless you get taken short, then - well you'll get a bit more immediate relief than you bargained for! With the storm season approaching, it falls to the gang to figure out just who is responsible for this plague and to thwart that plan before the jungle is reduced to splinters and ashes. What now ensues is hardly original, but it's still quite a fun, escapade-driven, adventure story with loads of different scenarios for the various characters to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat from. It's no better or worse than the routine Pixar and Dreamworks fayre that animates a colourful leafy environment and enlivens just about every beastie from a frog to an evil beaver, with some light comedy along the way. There are a couple of entertaining double acts, some gravity-defying wooden bombers and loads of fun pyrotechnics as the quest takes them through perils and pitfalls alike. Not great, nor especially memorable, but it passes ninety minutes easily enough - and that fish in it's bowl packs quite a punch!",6.0
COPA 71,CinemaSerf,"It's quite interesting that even now, there are those amongst the footballing establishment who dismiss this competition as little better than an unsanctioned exhibition event of no consequence whatsoever. If you watch it, however, you can't help but get a sense of the pride with which the women from six teams assembled in Mexico to play. James Erskine et al has done a quite an effective job tracking down many of the players who took part and at finding some grainy, but perfectly watchable, archive of the games and of the celebratory nature of the hosting country back in 1971. The narrative and commentaries take a pretty firm swipe at the men-only culture that prevailed in the sport - and amongst most of their advising medical professionals - which limited women's participation in the sport and though the film make precisely no attempt to balance it's clear objective with any counter-arguments about the perceived dangers to women players, or feature any interviews with anyone from FIFA or UEFA regarding their decision making rationale, this still makes for quite a powerful depiction of just how inclusive football, as a sport, can be. The contributors are engaging and as one Dane points out - she can knit and she can use a chainsaw, so why not play football?",7.0
Occupied City,Lachlan Thiele,"EXT. IT BELONGS IN A MUSEUM - DAY

Occupied City is redefining the 'Documentary' genre. This film is a series of stories passed onto Steve McQueen, now passing them onto us. It narrates those stories whilst giving us a glimpse into the current affairs in Amsterdam. This pure juxtaposition shows how far we have come yet how quickly we can turn back. The reason I've titled this review ""It's Belongs in A Museum"" is not because I have a ticket for the new Indiana Jones film here at Cannes (but it has little to do with that). This film isn't something to watch during a visit to the cinema; it should be on display somewhere, a four-and-a-half-hour loop of each moment, story, fact and stunning cinematography that this film has to offer. 

Suppose I explain why I'm so optimistic about this film yet only giving it 3.5 stars. In that case, it's because, as a film, anything more than 4 hours without a narrative flow is a complicated watch. Still, as I said, this belongs in a museum or an art gallery on display for you to sit and watch for a moment; when you're ready, you can leave but come back anytime. Yet I was in a cinema for more than 4 hours. This film would still be compelling at 2 hours long, yet McQueen leaves nothing on the cutting room floor. There were moments in which I wanted it to be over, but then another story or particular shot would drag me back in. But within this film, there is a tighter, more cohesive narrative where the simpler/less impactful stories are excluded. But it seems that McQueen wanted a leg in the race for the longest film of the Decade award. 

Overall, if you can watch this film, maybe not in cinemas but divide it up over four nights, giving you enough time to take in each story this film presents.

Handling the Undead,JJ Gonzalez,"A bleak and somewhat beautiful piece, “Handling the Undead” had my curiosity the moment it was announced. The first act was great though, with a haunting and mesmerizing score, which is consistent throughout the film. The ending is BIZARRE though, and is haunting as well. Unfortunately, it drags throughout the middle, and the protagonists act about as human as the zombies. Have no idea how they managed to waste Renate.",6.0
The Hypnosis,Brent Marchant,"Sometimes we can all use a little help in changing our behavior when we aren’t able to do so on our own, and hypnosis is one of the most commonly employed practices. But, in some cases, it can work so well that we may unintentionally end up overcompensating, prompting us to act out in ways that yield a whole new crop of issues to contend with. Such is the case with Vera (Asta Kamma August), who gives hypnosis a try to quit smoking, a behavior she regards as unhealthy and antisocial. However, Vera’s hypnotherapist (Karin de Frumerie) suspects that her patient’s reluctance in explaining her reasons for seeking out treatment suggests that she’s there for more than just kicking the habit. This hunch leads her to conduct a profoundly impactful hypnotherapy session that produces a radical, albeit somewhat ill-defined, change in her subject’s behavior. And, even though Vera seems to relish the effects of this change, it couldn’t have come at a worse time: just as Vera and her business and romantic partner, André (Herbert Nordrum), are about to pitch their new commercial venture to a group of select international investors at an elite pitch fest, an event where they receive guidance from a high-profile pitch coach (David Fukamachi Regnfors). During preparation for their presentation, Vera begins acting strangely unpredictably, even disorderly, toward others, including those whom she and André are most trying to win over. So what’s going on here? And what, if anything, can André do to salvage matters before everything falls apart? Writer-director Ernst De Geer’s delightfully quirky debut feature takes a humorously absurdist look at questions of social conformity, particularly when it comes to differentiating behavior that’s gleefully playful from that which is wholly unacceptable, especially in earnestly serious “grown-up” situations. It accomplishes this goal through a captivating mix of hilariously dry wit and cringeworthy drama, one that often makes viewers squirm while questioning exactly what’s going on. In fact, at times, the mix can be perplexing enough that audiences may be uncomfortably puzzled by what’s transpiring on the screen and what the director is going for – that is, until the surfacing of the big reveal, the one that exposes the source behind the emergence of Vera’s erratic behavior, one that plants a rollicking punctuation mark on this often-uproarious offering. Much of the credit for this goes to the film’s fine script and its superb ensemble cast, particularly protagonists August and Nordrum, who play off each other well and create a wry sense of humorously driven dramatic tension. I love movies that make it a point to stick pins in sanctimonious balloons and push over sacred cows, and this one does as good a job at that as I’ve seen in a while. “The Hypnosis” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but I’m only too happy to take more than a few good sips. Pass the milk and lemon, please.",8.0
A Mystery on the Cattle Hill Express,CinemaSerf,"Poor old farmer “Biff” is struggling to get anything to grow! The soil is as dead as a dodo even after his neighbour tries a rejuvenating rain dance! He’s at his wits end until, that is, his porcine neighbour and investor “Pauline” declares that she has a cunning plan and that they are all to rendezvous at the railway station next morning. That’s where they encounter the visionary inventor “Albert Einswine” who has developed an highly secret “superseed” that can thrive anywhere. Could this be salvation for “Biff”? Well not when it’s stolen - and he is deemed to be the prime suspect. “Albert” now summons the legendary investigator “Agatha Christensen” who enlists the assistance of the accused man’s children “Clara” and “Gavin” who are keen amateur sleuths - so maybe they can get to the bottom of the mystery before prison beckons for dad? It’s quite a fun animal-animation this. The story, set largely aboard a train, moves along quickly and there are a few twists and turns as we go along. It is clear with it’s message - if it looks too good to be true, then it probably is - and I quite enjoyed it for what is an admittedly over-long eighty minutes that has a friendly and engaging Aardman look to it.",6.0
The Lyricist Wannabe,CinemaSerf,"Though it does labour the joke a little after a while, this is actually quite a fun story about a tenacious young student who is determined to be a lyricist. Despite the fact that her teacher (Pak Hon Chu) claims nobody ever makes money writing songs (he's clearly never heard of Don Black, or Sir Tim Rice or Bernie Taupin!), and the fact that she cannot actually read music, she perseveres. She's not having much luck though - most of her work ends up being ""off-melody"" - with some quite hilariously double-entendre consequences, but ""Sze"" (Suet-Ying Chung) is determined. Now it doesn't really help the gist of this that many of her rhymes go to prove the obvious point that English, Cantonese and Mandarin have completely different tones and rhyming points - and that means that sometimes the subtitled versions of her lyrics are borderline surreal. They don't scan in the slightest in just about any language and her attempts to find a musician and/or singer to work with just seem doomed to failure. She's persistent, though, and as the years go by she does just about everything to convince the record industry that her's is a skill they want! This works quite well at engagingly poking fun at the whole songwriting business. The haphazard way in which things work - or don't, the sheer luck involved, good looks, face fits, back-stabbing and well, you have to feel just a bit sorry for her long suffering boyfriend ""Zeke"" (Yukki Tai) and, for that matter, her easy on the eye chanteur ""Mak"" (Anson Chan) who constantly vacillates between encouraging and placating her somewhat erratic passion. It's a story about a dream (and for a listening audience - a nightmare) and is quite enjoyable to watch.",7.0

Anselm,Brent Marchant,"Imagine having the vision – and the means – to build your own little world, one that reflects your philosophical, artistic and personal sensibilities. If you’re German multi-media artist Anselm Kiefer, it’s not only entirely possible, but also an undertaking that feels as though it’s been compelled into existence, as seen in this poetic new documentary from filmmaker Wim Wenders. This inventive, intimate look into the life, work and beliefs of this artistic icon examines how his upbringing and major influences shaped the person Kiefer ultimately became, one of the most prolific, diverse and challenging creatives of the 20th Century. Through interviews with the artist, archive and contemporary footage of his work, and interpretive reenactments of Kiefer as an eminently curious youth and as a bold innovator as a young adult, viewers witness how he emerged as a force to be reckoned with in the art world in the nature, content and messages of his creations. The film explores his mythological, metaphysical and philosophical insights, along with his relentless passion for artistically depicting Germany’s role in World War II, an effort that many of his fellow countrymen found off-putting but that he insisted must not be forgotten or ignored, despite widespread public opinion to the contrary. Then there’s the establishment of his Gesamtkunstwerk – or “universal artwork” – at his 35-hectare compound community in Barjac, France, an attempt at manifesting a work of art incorporating as many different types of creations as possible, truly a world unto itself. All of this is accomplished through a narrative that’s more thematically driven than one providing a rote laundry list of accomplishments. Because of this, viewers unfamiliar with Kiefer’s work, history and influences may find the film somewhat difficult to follow at times, but that’s more than compensated for by Wenders’ stunning cinematography, especially its brilliant employment of 3-D technology, a practice virtually unheard of in documentary work. Given the unconventional nature of “Anselm,” the picture clearly won’t appeal to everyone, including those enamored with documentaries. However, for those seeking something different, inspiring and beautiful to look at, this one is made for you.",7.0
Autobiography,valardohaeriz,"Gripping. Real. Bare. Truly a dark yet hopeful movie about how power and status typically manifest itself and predates others in Indonesia. Everything is laid bare in this movie. You will see local culture as it truly is. The corruption. The poverty. The blind unawareness of the populace. 

Yet amidst all that lies certain hope, and perhaps that strong message is what carried this movie throughout nearly 2 hours of its runtime. Can justice be enacted through an act of injustice? The movie asks you, the viewers, to answer this conundrum.",10.0
Last Swim,Screencrib,"**Amazing directorial debut from Iranian British director Sasha Nathwani !** 
I was lucky to attend the film's premiere on the 16th in Berlin where it is currently nominated for best first feature film and opened the generation 14+ section.

My favourite thing about the movie is the way it takes you on an emotional journey laughing one minute and crying the next. The music score is also a personal highlight - blending both British and Iranian sounds to compliment the blended cultural heritage of the film's protagonist and ease you into the story. A few scenes play out like a music video which play on Sasha's background directing music videos. 

Another highlight would be the cast who naturally complement one another and showcase the talent of Shakira Dowling as a casting director. Stand out talent - Lydia Fleming.",10.0
A Wolfpack Called Ernesto,CinemaSerf,"Following a few characters called ""Ernesto"", this documentary follows what can really only be described as the grooming of young people from eight years old through to an adulthood where crime is the only option. Petty crime at first, drug-running for older people, but the first gun takes ambitions to another level and the commentary delivers a statement along the lines that killing a man is fine because we all get killed one day! This isn't a chaotic existence. The gangs have an hierarchy, a loyalty and an inter-dependency that proves to be solid and supportive if you live within it's rules. It's a sub-culture based on survival, the dream of prosperity and an escape from the drudgery of their largely poverty-stricken existances surrounded by a broader society which they feel offers them little but regulation and inhibition. The narrative illustrates well the prodigious nature of gun-crime in Mexico where life is cheap, but to be honest - I hated the photography. Clearly, anonymity was important but the constant use of phone-cameras with obscured faces or mounted on what looked like a rucksack just made me feel a bit dizzy after a while. There is only so much of the back of an head I wanted to see before I felt that I was riding backie on an undulating bike. The camera always tracking fractionally, and often quite jerkily, behind the body movements. Though that style does add and sustain a sense of intensity to the story, it became quite uncomfortable to watch and I found myself just too distracted. It's certainly a story worth telling, and watching - but as a cinema experience, it's not the most comfortable to watch - on any level.",6.0
Gassed Up,CinemaSerf,"""Ash"" (Stephen Odubola) lives at home with his young sister and his permanently absent or stoned mother. His dream is to start a business of his own (he likes to fix things) and to get her into rehab. To that end he's mixed up with four of his mates in a snatch 'n grab scheme using mopeds to pinch mobile phones and handbags from unsuspecting folks on the street. They sell these on to ""Shaz"" (Jelena Gavrilovic) who happens to be the cousin of the gang's leader ""Dubz"" (Taz Skylar). ""Ash"" finds the shoebox under his bed is gradually filling up, but when he's told his mother's medical costs are likely to run to £25,000 he realises that nicking a few phones ain't going cut it. After a raid to get themselves some new transport goes awry, with one of their number a bit too handy with the spray-on acid, they are reduced to four and given a new task. Rob a jewellery store and make some proper money. When this goes tragically wrong, ""Ash"" and his pals ""Kabz"" (Mohammed Mansaray) and ""Mole"" (Tobias Jowett) have to persuade their briefly ostracised mate ""Roach"" (Craige Middleburg) to come back and help them - because their paymasters are still demanding a sackful of loot! Up until this point, the film is actually quite decent - a diverse group of life-long mates all carrying out what they reckon are victimless crimes to make some cash. Once the violent elements kick in, though, the plot really heads south. What made it a bit different is subsumed into a rather amateurishly directed affair with implausible police chases, even more unlikely robbery scenarios and just one chunk too much of bad decision making - on and off the screen. Skylar is a man with charisma, but the rest of these characters never light up the screen or the story and by the sequel-suggesting conclusion, I'd sort of lost interest. It is worth a watch with all the ""life's there for the taking"" stuff going on, but it'll be on the television soon enough and I'm sure it can wait til then.",6.0
Gassed Up,r96sk,"Most certainly not perfect, I'm not convinced by it I won't lie, but... <em>'Gassed Up'</em> narrowly does enough.

Making your lead characters criminals is always a brave choice, you're almost setting yourself up for failure from a film point of view. I'm personally cool with a movie's main lot not being total good guys, like <em>'The Fast and the Furious'</em> is literally one of my favourite flicks ever, but it does make it more difficult to root for the people onscreen.

In this execution of making the audience do the aforementioned, I think this film doesn't do the best job. I appreciate the backstory we get for them, well at least for a few of them, and it does work in making you understand their point of views. However, I'm just not sure if it's enough to overcome what the characters are actually doing; it's not like they are Robin Hoods... well, I guess they actually are robin hoods (ha! get it! sorry!) but you get what I mean.

There's also an inconsistency in that they avoid going up a level in their activities as they know it'll bring more heat - yet not long after stating that they brazenly take it up a notch anyway. A possible 'out' is they are blinded by wonga but that's unconvincing. All this is just me saying that the writing isn't the best, in my opinion of course.

What does save this is that the feel of the film is competent, it's fairly well put together and moves along at a decent pace. The cast are also positives, with Stephen Odubola being the clear standout as Ash. Taz Skylar and Mohammed Mansaray are alright, though Craige Middleburg and Mae Muller (strange casting for the latter) are more miss than hit. I would've liked Steve Toussaint to have been used more.

Glad I watched this at the cinema though, always nice to support productions from the homeland. Two groups of two were in there with me, though one duo did decide to leave with a good chunk of the movie left; I see other reviewers have noted likewise  - ouch! I can possibly see why if I'm totally truthful, but for me I just about got enough out of it. I could easily be rating this a step lower, though.",7.0
Homecoming,Lachlan Thiele,"EXT. HOW TO MAKE A CANNES MOVIE – NIGHT

Homecoming (Le Retour) was my final screening on the second day at Cannes 2023, and I had yet to be blown away by a film, but Homecoming had a premise that interested me. A woman flees her home due to 'tragic circumstances' but returns many years later with her two daughters. This 'circumstance' intrigued me; the film opens with that moment, Kheídidja and her two daughters leave Corsica, but the reason isn't presented to us; this motive was to be developed and revealed over the 2-hour run time.

Homecoming's most significant strength is the relationship between the two daughters, Jessica and Farah, and their mother. While I thought this film would be a character piece focusing on Kheídidja' tragic circumstance' for leaving, the film moves on from that very quickly, completely losing focus on the mother and fixating on the coming-of-age tropes for her two daughters. The film isn't about Kheídidja coming to terms with her loss and reason for initially leaving it all behind. Instead, it's about two young adults navigating the island to discover who they are. The trio of actors who play these characters do an excellent job of building a beautiful relationship. However, under that immensely incredible bond is a story that doesn't know where it wants to go. Still, somehow these performers have created something from that mess and formed a believable family dynamic.

Remember the first paragraph about the 'tragic circumstance'? Yeah, just like the film, I will entirely skip over it and forget that was the mystery we set up in the first place. Let's talk more about the girls. This review is titled 'How to Make a Cannes Movie' because all the elements are there, French (tick), LGBTQIA+ (tick), minority (tick), and societal issues (tick); all the boxes are there, and it's a stock-standard Coming-of-Age film for Cannes. But no matter, this film had massive strengths but some hard weaknesses. Leaving me with a clean 3.5-star film. Stay for the performances; ignore the plot.

Bye Bye Tiberias,Brent Marchant,"Memorializing one’s family history is an exercise that can provide a valuable record of our relatives’ past and establish the legacy that has carried through the years to the present day. It can also teach us much about what distinguishes one’s kindreds in terms of their characteristics, accomplishments and values. The impact of that can be quite revelatory, too, producing a chronicle of inspiring insights and profound achievements of one’s relations, especially those that emerged in the face of challenge, adversity and cultural limitations. In her second documentary feature, director Lina Soualem has sought to capture a loving record of those qualities in this highly personal film that charts the lives of four generations of her family’s women, including herself, her mother (Emmy-nominated actress Hiam Abbass), her grandmother and her great-grandmother. The picture primarily follows the experiences of the filmmaker’s three ancestral generations during their lives in their Palestinian homeland from the days of the creation of Israel in 1948 to the time of Abbass’s emigration to France, where she began her acting career and gave birth to her daughter. In doing so, the film juxtaposes the family’s individual history with that of the larger cultural backdrop against which their story is set. It also provides viewers with a look at the actress’s return to Palestine with her daughter after a prolonged absence, a time of remembrance and reflection. As touching and uplifting as this story can be, however, there are times when it starts to play more like a highly polished home movie than a theatrical documentary. It also would have benefitted from a deeper look at the historical back story and how its events helped shape the lives of these courageously determined women. That’s particularly true in the wake of recent developments (even though this film was made before them), given that the inclusion of such background material would have leant a more profound understanding to the longstanding prevailing circumstances in Palestine and the role that they played in the unfolding of this family’s story. Moreover, the film seems to puzzlingly downplay Abbass’s career accomplishments, achievements that marked a key turning point in the family’s history, one specifically inspired by her yearning to leave the “suffocating” conditions of life in her homeland. Soualem certainly deserves kudos for her attempt to deftly mesh personal and cultural considerations in this film, her heart clearly in the right place. However, the overall mix doesn’t quite gel as well as it could have, leaving viewers with a story that may be moving and poetic but that somehow feels somewhat incomplete. Perhaps that comes from being too close to the material, no matter how sincere one’s intents might be – and how earnestly one wants to see those goals fulfilled.",6.0

Banel & Adama,Lachlan Thiele,"<b>EXT. DESTINY - DAY</b>

<i>Banel & Adama</i> is about destiny, loss and sacrifice. Luckily <i>Banel & Adama</i> doesn't sacrifice anything to present us with this story. 

Narratively it flows, opening on the love of our two protagonists: <i>Banel</i>, a woman who recently lost her partner and <i>Adama</i>, who has recently lost both father and brother (FYI, his brother was Banel's partner). With that recent loss, they are brought together out of, at least at the beginning, love and responsibility within the community and religion. 

<i>Banel & Adama</i> have a great score matching fantastic cinematography at the start and end, relying upon the story to keep you engaged. Thankfully that story unfolds truths about their relationship and forces them to fulfil birthrights and responsibilities. 

Unfortunately, the believability of their relationship is thin, and what's even harder to believe is the twist of how they came together, which is so quickly thrown in with minimal set-up and then so forgotten to make it seem like it's a plot line that was pulled last minute. 

The first and final 20 minutes are its most
outstanding moments, visually, narratively and audibly. Making it worth your time.

Séance Games - Metaxu,MayaRamirez,Incredible Gen Z horror movie! I enjoyed every second. The pacing is on point. The acting is top notch. The production is perfection. The special effects are realistic yet imaginative. The storyline is relatable and intriguing. It mimics a classic murder mystery while encapsulating a horrific tragedy. Tane McClure did a phenomenal job directing. I am impressed and mesmerized. Definitely check it out!,10.0
Bag of Patience,notprasun_,"The mind of Sameer Rai fascinates me,  and this is coming from someone who just watched Poor Things like an hour ago.",
The Seven Seas of Sage,thecabbageboy,"The film is a celebration of the inherent dramatism and queerness of Southeast Asia history, as well as a wonderful exploration of the trope of found family. The characters are hilarious, complex and so well-explored within a short runtime; at first glance, the titular character (as advertised) is a silly babygirl, and over time, we get to see the nuance in every interaction! The dynamics are absolutely insane, everybody is so different and yet, their relationships manage to bring out the best in each other. Overall, fantastic writing, amazing creative direction, 100/10 would recommend",
